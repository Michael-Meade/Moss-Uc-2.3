Ey what's going on man?
It's your boy Lil Dicky
A.K.A Mr. Left-Ward-Sloping-Penis
I got a story for y'all man
Peep this
Yes sir

Now I been dating this girl named Katie, she hot as hell
And her body crazy, vagina shaven and it don't smell
And I don't fall for chickens
But this one a little different
Body sickening,
Plus she really good at making breaded chicken
Got me thinking she the one man
Even fully clothed, shawty really fun man
Get a lotta hoes, but none of those come close
I swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposed
Oh yeah there's one more thing
And I know this shit gonna sound insane
But I still haven't hit it
I admit it, I wish I was kidding
Never been up inside before
Because shes only fucked one guy before
And though I really wanna boink this whore
She ma sweetie 3.14
So I'm staying patient, and masturbating,
And now ma heart is sorta racing
Cause she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating
Hell yeah, I'm down, I'm bout to go all out
I'm gonna pound that crazy, like an elaborate black man handshake
But on the way to crib, we pass this kid,
And he seem to know who Katie is
So I say "who this" and she say
Dicky, this is my ex boyfriend Jim"

And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm looking at this dude I can't believe my eyes
Cause he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life
He's got the thickest head of hair, chiseled jaw, an egregious bod
Man this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian God
And now I'm looking at ma chick, cause his dick's been inside her raw

Awww damn
Man this is crazy
I can't believe this guy used to fuck ma lady
I bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti
Katie's hugging and squeezing his shoulder blades
And I'm bugging and queasy, this ain't okay
And then they say, "let's get drinks" so I say okay
Even though I was about to get laid!
Man this motherfucker look like Ashton
Combined with a little Hugh Jackman
In other words, he's so damn attractive
So damn tan he gotta have a little black in him
Now I'm in the back with him, sipping on some 'gnac with him
And he paying for it all, he investment banking...
I'm acting, like I ain't distracted
But I'm reenacting him and Katie banging
And now I'm feeling pissed, so I go and take a piss
Mid stream, I look left and guess who it is
And I had to see, and I was mad discrete
And I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek
Oh my God Becky, look at that cock

And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm looking at his dick, I can't believe my eyes
Because he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life
And now I'm staring at this dude's soft dick with a lotta hate
Because the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate
And I don't know if I can date ma girl after tonight

Aw damn

I don't know what to do
Dude's dick is really huge
I didn't realize a penis could be so smooth
I know she's mission that
My penis isn't that
I'm looking closer I think that his dick has abs
Six pack on a dick
Now what the fuck is that
It's so long and thick
It's like a punching bag
I'm saying it's so shaven, head is amazing
Got ma dick looking like a raisin
Skin tone insane, man he's hung like Saddam Hussein, it's crazy
What the fuck should I do?
He gotta Ruth's Chris dick, and mine's a drive through...
I think it's time to
Tell Katie ma goodbyes
Cause I simply can't survive
After seeing what was in between his thighs
So I tell her

That this dude's gotta dick that I don't comprehend
I had to move ma neck to see it end to end
I mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense
And I think it's for the best if this comes to an end
Because the sex with him must have been the best
And I would say let's just be friends
But I think I would just think about his dick all the time, so goodbye
Then she told me Dicky I don't really know what to say
Because I dated this dude in the second grade
So I don't know about his dick, now let's go home and get you laid

And then I took her to ma crib, and you know that we barely slept
And I gave her an O like I was selling crack, and when I came
I pulled out and nutted all over her left thigh
And upper mid-section region
You can call that the pelvis
Some would even call that the pubic bone
Leave the pubes at home
Making this up on the spot
Fuck you know about it
I'm about to go paper-mache my own dick and ride it
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy, can I come over after school?
(After school)
We can hang around by the pool
(Hang by the pool)
Did your mom get back from her business trip?
(Business trip)
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip?
(Give me the slip)
You know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown up now
Baby, can't you see?
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want
And I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong but
I'm in love with Stacy's mom
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn?
(Mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on
(Towel on)
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared
(The way she stared)
And the way she said
"You missed a spot over there"
(A spot over there)
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out
Your mom could use a guy like me
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want
And I've waited so long
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong but
I'm in love with Stacy's mom
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
(She's got it going on)
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
(Waited and waited)
Stacy can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
I'm in love with
(Stacy's mom oh oh)
I'm in love with
(Stacy's mom oh oh)
Wait a minute
Stacy can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong but
I'm in love with Stacey's mom
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

[Intro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah... sounds kinda beautiful don't it?
Fair warning, I'm about to shit on it

Let's go, let's go, let's go

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Okay now you already know that Dicky been about that flow all day
I used to beg to get blow J's, I'm over head now, stowaway
My team about that money tho, we scrappin fo that dummy dough
Don't act like das yo money ho, das nacho cheese das doritos
And I spit that hot shit all day long, gotta room full a hot chicks, no Krayshawn
And you know they blonde, got em in suede thongs
And they ass meat lookin like filet mignon
You can find me, back a da club I'm wylin
Shots in a mafuckan mug, I'm buyin
No I ain't a mafuckan thug, but I will cut a rug in this mafucka
Carpet violence
In the crib with dat AC on
No fib, ya girl up in a lacy thong
Cause the kid been known to make a racy song
Dicky got it goin on like I'm Stacy's mom
I'm higher than I ever been, flyer than a pelican
No lie see mo vagina than a common OBGYN
I'm ballin whatchu know bout that
In a purple charlotte throwback hat
And I merc these tracks when I heard this rap
Got me actin like I'm erkel, did I do that
Hell yeah I did, you know I do it
And the way they fallin for me like I'm boys with cupid
In a truck with a slut with a butt, get a nut,
Call that bitch bill buckner the way she blew it
I'm high off weed and oxycodon
I'm a caffeine fiend takin shots a soda
Wish I was big pimpin on a yacht with Hova
But I'm happy that ma girl lemme motorboat her
I make this shit look easy dude
I spit dat sick dat sneeze achu
And who knew that baddest was a
Nappy headed greasy Jew?

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Lil Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Sicker than the holocaust
Dat muthafuckin jewish flow
That third reich raw
Concentration camp cold
Now we rollin in that mothafuckin dough
Das dat Jewish flow
Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Lil Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Sicker than the holocaust
Dat muthafuckin jewish flow
That Auschwitz sick, gas chamber kinda shit
Now I got german bitches all up on ma dick
Das dat jewish flow

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Blowin up, you know that's DI
Flowin since ya boy was knee high
Now I'm grown up and ya'll buggin cause I'm buzzin like a beehive
Shout out to my city, Philly, big ups to PA
I went to college in VA but now I'm chillin by the bay
And I got ma shit on lock, cause I ball like a jock
They attached to my balls, like a small little cock
No bullshit, dicky do it big no doubt
And ya girl in the whirpool, wet no draught
And she get so loud, I be like slow down
Lemme relish this shit girl, no kraut
And then I beat that like it was a title bout
And then I plant my seed that ho got plowed
Ew you so nasty, lil dicky you so nasty
I got green knees, why you keep yo crib so grassy?
I do it how I do it baby swag out the ass
And I'm shittin on you dick heads like a drag the asshooole
Don't cha know my girls DTF
And they pretty damn fine das PDF
I'm a open that, I'm a cum press that
I got Adobe Acrobat
Ma homies say that pussy takes a toll on dudes
But my EZ pass dick just slides right through ooo

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
You know that dicky bout to bubble up
Fresha than a mothafuck
I gotta gang a bitches, whatchu know about a cluster fuck
The back of the crack of that ass is poking outcha pants
I'm a crack from the back and ejaculate all on that ass
N'amsayin I'm cool ass mafucka try to see me
If you want ma life, better find a genie
In the club tryna choose, but I'm bein greedy
So you know I pick six like a deion TD
Cause I got that swag that y'all don't have
Is that yo girl, das ma bad
The sickest shit out two lips, heavy flow, I spit vagina flaps
And y'ain't even want it with da boy
Cause the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I.
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Shit, I'm living good up in this bitch
Dicky rollin round the city, blowin good up in that wip
I ain't black or Dominican, not Hispanic or Indian
So imprisonment is not a predicament, I envision
For a white boy
Hollatcha muthafuckin kike, boy
Higher than a muthafuckin kite, it's iight boi
They ain't suspicious of jews
I'll show contrition it's cool
Slap on the wrist, get ma daddy to choose
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise
Das what I do kid
Happy that my name ain't stupid
Dave coulda been Daquan with a few kids
But now I'm farting, overeating at meals,
If ain't I gotta theme party, Ion't be at goodwill
I'm dentist paying, tennis playing, smellin on some cabernet
And I ain't gay but if I was, everything would be okay, look...
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes
But ma premium channels mean tyler perry's never live
Getting tickets, they sick, I sit at the eagle 45
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive (food chainssss)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho
Happy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up
Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka
They up in heels
And tummy tuckin, theyon't grub except for takin them pills, foreal...
And ion't bleach shit
Ion't gotta eat dick
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis
Smoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing
In disagreements, I participate without weeping
And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that
Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut
So what up
Ya boy cut up
But eat butter
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother... to still love her
And I been getting better looking with age
But a guy can get who he deserves with a horrible face
Seal interlude
I go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake
And if impregnate I can pack a back and be on my way, but good luck girl!

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man
First off I'm a dude so
There was a one in two chance of that sucking
But now I can run a seven minute mile
I can defend my self adequately
I can be logical
I can get along with my room-mates
Watch serious movies without being scared by them
And the on top of that I'm white
Which is like, amazing because
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country
I get my hair cut at a salon
People hold the door open for me which is nice
Er, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people
It ain't about that
It's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying?
But on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense
I've been thinking about that shit a lot
Because like if I could say the N-word, it would really help my rhyme scheme out
It's like the perfect filler word
[Intro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah
Eh this gon' be the shit that when motherfuckers hear it
They gon' be like 'Damn, that dude can rap'
Know what I'm saying?
Like, like, like, like

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Look, I'm the man bro
Iont really care what the fuck you think
Steak look rare but I grub dat pink
And the grundle stink
And I bump N-sync
Don't suck dick, but I blow dat good
Don't want shit but a ho that would
Lemme hold dat, bend and fold that
Get a Kodak, cowboy, Jerry Jones dat, lemme own that
Word... fuck that girl
Jew got hair, never cut them curls
Truth or dare with a cute au paire
Get a room to share, hit a boom, Pat Burrell
Spit dat turd, das dat shit
Gotcha girl up on ma dick
I'm bout to sperm up on dem hips
Don't wanna murder us a kid
Oh shit... whatchu say
Don'tchu do this erry day?
Don'tchu usually go with double meat when you eat chipotle
Don't your crew lack someone black, but you want one to hang no slave
And I heard your boo got so much back like she bangin' that Notre Dame clock
Faded tho.
Fuckin bitches you'd label undateable
Missing birthdays, hay belated brah
Naked out in san fran on that rooftop
I got tan cans, no tube top
Cause I'm the mafuckan man goddamn,
And these mafuckas bitches full a shit like zoo mops so

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
Look, you can do it, you can say it
I been through it, you can play it
Yea I'm jewish, so I'm praying das yo boo cause I'm a take her.
Dinner at the crib, feedin kobe like a laker
You know what it is, I'm a mafuckan K-I-K-E
You don't play wanna play D
Goin down low on ya dame
Getcha mafuckin weight up
You can find a cracker getting paid like a sedar
All day
Word up
All K

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Whoa, afikoman in a flow, das a pro
Whatchu know bout dicky creamin up in hoes
No ho ho
Whatchu know about a balla
Born and raised on the kaballah
Tryna make a dollar, until I'm cakin and stackin challa
I'm hollerin atcha daughter like when the fuck you tryna get it
Dat vagina fitted custom for humpin dis little dicky
Puffin' sticky while she bangin' on my wood
Superstitious, pussy good
Cooter vicious, within a minute I finished
But I ain't trippin off no quick nut
And no pain in the butt, ma shit's tough
And ma dick's sucked, and yo dick sucks
But real talk I could never give an inch up
We tippin cups in the strip club, no flip cup
With a fit butt rubbin on my Nike zip up
No whisenhunt, but them bad bitches get cut
Gotta get up so the dick tucked
What the fuck you doin
This that heavy fuckin flow
Word to pads
Wearing out a lotta boxes on the road
Word to plaid
And I gotta have my pops no cereal
Das word to dad
Watching Breaking Bad, fucking with' Hank and sippin tab boi.

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah, I'm saying
If they can say the N word
I sure as fuck can say Kike
Do something about it, pussy
[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Another Friday afternoon
Dicky chillin in his room
Got a teddy on the bed, you bet he playing little spoon
Pimpin I ain't fittna move shit
Bitches getting stupid
But I ain't getting hammered less you handing me a tool kit
And yea I know the cool kids are drinkin at the bar
But I just ate a chicken parm
And then got faded in ma car
And there's tomato on ma navel, as I'm layin in ma arms
Debating if it's safe to wait because bathrooms kinda far
Goddamn.
I don't wanna go nowhere
Why the fuck these bitches call ma cell
Ion't really care what the fuck they do
I just wanna lay in bed and jerk off ma self
Sun is going down, I bet the club been going down
But I don't wanna fuck with nuffin less it's something in the house
And now I'm naked on the couch
With raisenets in ma mouth
I'm playin a stupid asian in NBA 2k12
And I'm beatin that ass with the Utah jazz,
Youjizz on the tablet, loading multiple tabs
As I pack bowls, mac pro, chattin with a black ho
Dat want a redskin sack, call dat bitch orakpo
Crack flow, fuckin with a lotta fuckin snacks bro
Cookies in the oven, whatcha know bout how I stack dough

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And I ain't got no mafuckan plans ya diggg
It's Friday night and I'm stayin in
Don't wanna drink, man you couldn't even pay the kid
Who knew that layin in the crib would make a hit
So put ya hands in the air if you stayin innnn
If you don't even care what day it is
Ya had a long week, roll weed, take a hit,
Go on Demand, take a gander and play some shittt

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
Okay ma cell is getting bombed yo
Bitches want a don
To come meet em greet em leave with em, freak em at they condo
Ma penis like Chicago
D Rose pronto
But I won't be scorin less it's fifa with ronaldo
Cause I ain't comin out, I'm getting freaky, Michael Jackson
Keepin up with the kardashians
As I'm eatin easy mac and
As I'm peein I'm seein penis with pieces of a napkin
Need to clean it, I'm creamin without a boo, dis ain't Aladdin
Achu, das what the rest ya'll do erry time ya'll spit some sicknin shit
The fridge gotta lil bit left in it so now I'm raiden sub zero to finish him
Damn... how you do dat there, you kickin it like Liu Kang here
Ma pubic hair super bare whatcha know about a jew with nare
And iont think I wanna brag, but stayin inside the pad
Was basically the greatest day that I've had
Holla back if you don't really wanna pregame, and wait for cabs
Would rather eat a fuckin cheese cake, and take a nap
I'm double bundled up under covers I'm comfy den a mafucka
Bumpin to something usher, while grubbing on some fuddruckers
Say I ain't the man ho
Playin on demand shows
You can get retarded, but lil dicky think he stayin home
[Intro: Lil Dicky]
See back in highschool
I ain't even know I could rap
So the hits late, but nobody throwin the flag
Goin fifth grade with it, Dicky opening snacks
Because the kid made different like a joke in Iraq
Now check it

[Verse: Lil Dicky]
Never thought I wanna pass the bar
But I gotta get fancy car
So I got up on the beat, beat on it like
Evander sparring partner, smarter art
When I master bars
These weak bitches gotta leave, dicky dissin' em all
To listen to y'all is sorta like a flick in the balls
Foreal tho
Cause they don't spit it real as D do

The lame bros, better learn to make a single
Or ya mayn bout to have these rappers playin some bingoooo... yeah

If lil dicky ruin rap, they poopin on it's coffin now
So if you heard of a jewish rapper you know who they talkin bout

The family, demanding, ya man be

Confessing that I'm hittin only cause I'm nice at spittin

On these curves like it's griffey in the third with these pitches
Iight, the kids aiight, legit polite

The white dude's known to be recording it right
You jabronies write a stupid chorus lighter than cubes
Commercials

But these lucky bitches, they ain't gotta work again
All these chickens in the crib's like a birthed a hen
So I be over-cumming definition circumvent, ya dig?
Cold spittin, admit it, I'm rippin shit up, like a ticket stub
And givin a clinic, these bitches isn't sick enough to get up in it tho

It's really fuckin scary magic Johnson near mosquitos
But I'm nearly fuckin there, these bitches bout to feed me Cheetos
Cause Ion't really like the mess
Pretty clear right here that the kike the best (that's my n word so chill)
Never scared, nor embarrassed, ask ma ex

The knee slappin' unexpected, word to Juno's tike, I'm out.
