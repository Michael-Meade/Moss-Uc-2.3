The year Thirty Twenty Two 
How did this happen
To get a jew with some scruff to mack a beauty with boobs and a butt
'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight
Fuck your man it's my name that he's screaming!
How do I know that though I wasn't taught
You're the chosen ones, you'll just have to trust me
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy Do you fuck with the war
Now look at all these muthafuckas out on Pride Rock
