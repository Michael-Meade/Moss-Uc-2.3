That's the target I'll hit
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore,
We're real men, and we like sportz
Rude boy living in the shanty dorms 
Foreal tho
I-I, you know what, actually, you're gonna laugh at me. I disagree with you, I think anybody's mother would do that.
Where the bad bitches on this mediocre cock atttt
They just can't take charge so they floppin'
God ain't wrong, what the fuck was he thinking
I been through it, you can play it
Thinking through the words like I read it
I'm the truth dude
But i swear to god I ain't heard nothing
Ha, funny
Switch to beat up
And if I get oral herpes on the pussy and we fuck
I know
Now she tryin' to up the ante
It need more shit
They been hesitant as if my credit low
And my permanent fog is burning like smog
But these lucky bitches, they ain't gotta work again
You know what it is, I'm a mafuckan K-I-K-E
All my friends thought Dicky was a joke
They ain't suspicious of jews
Man
Alone and regretting the whole thing
Yeah, but where you gonna punch em? 
Without coming off all gay n shit
This the type of line where people squeeze they dick to prevent pissing
Sup y'all
I never even done cocaine
Ask security, I ainâ€™t fraught
Please let me freak right now
I'm on the deck with my boys, motherfucker yeah
Not on a date, but we're goin' places oh OK
With a mama and knowledge of commas and college
Now they looking at the boy like the main event
Ay, we gon' save that money
Was in the number one department in the country
And shit'll hit them quicker than an edible
Shit was hidden, Waldo
And I turned around like I heard something
Sam coming through with a bottle of the Cap
And I just wanna hit the floor with pauly D
You raised me right
Find the guy to be amusing as fuck
Hey, that's a good ass life
Oh you want a condensed list
