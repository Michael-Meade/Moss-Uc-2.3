Bitches know I holla good
Graduated college with a bag of fucking honors but instead of making dollars

And what started as a joke became the hottest fucking shit
Killin bitches Michael Vickin women, you know what dis is
Semi colons in ma texts ma instant message game is sick ho
Fuck that shit, when I rub that bitch
When I be up in the club I gotta tuck that dick
When I bring a chicken back, and then I fuck that bitch
I'm a cum quick, I ain't playin witcha
Ay you kno, I'm spittin crack up on the track,

Who try to rap, but I'm just sayin that

Errybody love the funny little buddy makin jams now

Please don't fucking over stare
Das who I be stroking, young and smoking like they over DARE

But I am not the most efficient closer when I'm sober scared
So I'm drinkin, fuck you thinkin
Middle day das word to lincoln
Ma left foot is always stinkin
I ball good so I ain't blinkin
Maybe whatcha know about a muthafuckin dog
Fuckin cats up the ass metaphorically... pause.
Ey what's going on man
It's your boy Lil Dicky
A.K.A Mr. Left-Ward-Sloping-Penis
I got a story for y'all man
Peep this
Yes sir
Now I been dating this girl named Katie, she hot as hell
And her body crazy, vagina shaven and it don't smell
And I don't fall for chickens
But this one a little different
Body sickening,
Plus she really good at making breaded chicken
Got me thinking she the one man
Even fully clothed, shawty really fun man
Get a lotta hoes, but none of those come close
I swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposed
Oh yeah there's one more thing
And I know this shit gonna sound insane
But I still haven't hit it
I admit it, I wish I was kidding
Never been up inside before
Because shes only fucked one guy before
And though I really wanna boink this whore
She ma sweetie 3.14
So I'm staying patient, and masturbating,
And now ma heart is sorta racing
Cause she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating
Hell yeah, I'm down, I'm bout to go all out
I'm gonna pound that crazy, like an elaborate black man handshake
But on the way to crib, we pass this kid,
And he seem to know who Katie is
So I say who this and she say
Dicky, this is my ex boyfriend Jim
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm looking at this dude I can't believe my eyes
Cause he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life
He's got the thickest head of hair, chiseled jaw, an egregious bod
Man this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian God
And now I'm looking at ma chick, cause his dick's been inside her raw
Awww damn
Man this is crazy
I can't believe this guy used to fuck ma lady
I bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti
Katie's hugging and squeezing his shoulder blades
And I'm bugging and queasy, this ain't okay
And then they say, let's get drinks so I say okay
Even though I was about to get laid!
Man this motherfucker look like Ashton
Combined with a little Hugh Jackman
In other words, he's so damn attractive
So damn tan he gotta have a little black in him
Now I'm in the back with him, sipping on some 'gnac with him
And he paying for it all, he investment banking...
I'm acting, like I ain't distracted
But I'm reenacting him and Katie banging
And now I'm feeling pissed, so I go and take a piss
Mid stream, I look left and guess who it is
And I had to see, and I was mad discrete
And I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek
Oh my God Becky, look at that cock
And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
But as I'm looking at his dick, I can't believe my eyes
Because he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life
And now I'm staring at this dude's soft dick with a lotta hate
Because the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate
And I don't know if I can date ma girl after tonight
Aw damn
I don't know what to do
Dude's dick is really huge
I didn't realize a penis could be so smooth
I know she's mission that
My penis isn't that
I'm looking closer I think that his dick has abs
Six pack on a dick
Now what the fuck is that
It's so long and thick
It's like a punching bag
I'm saying it's so shaven, head is amazing
Got ma dick looking like a raisin
Skin tone insane, man he's hung like Saddam Hussein, it's crazy
What the fuck should I do
He gotta Ruth's Chris dick, and mine's a drive through...
I think it's time to
Tell Katie ma goodbyes
Cause I simply can't survive
After seeing what was in between his thighs
So I tell her
That this dude's gotta dick that I don't comprehend
I had to move ma neck to see it end to end
I mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense
And I think it's for the best if this comes to an end
Because the sex with him must have been the best
And I would say let's just be friends
But I think I would just think about his dick all the time, so goodbye
Then she told me Dicky I don't really know what to say
Because I dated this dude in the second grade
So I don't know about his dick, now let's go home and get you laid
And then I took her to ma crib, and you know that we barely slept
And I gave her an O like I was selling crack, and when I came
I pulled out and nutted all over her left thigh
And upper mid-section region
You can call that the pelvis
Some would even call that the pubic bone
Leave the pubes at home
Making this up on the spot
Fuck you know about it
I'm about to go paper-mache my own dick and ride it
Yeah... sounds kinda beautiful don't it
Fair warning, I'm about to shit on it
Let's go, let's go, let's go
[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Okay now you already know that Dicky been about that flow all day
I used to beg to get blow J's, I'm over head now, stowaway
My team about that money tho, we scrappin fo that dummy dough
Don't act like das yo money ho, das nacho cheese das doritos
And I spit that hot shit all day long, gotta room full a hot chicks, no Krayshawn
And you know they blonde, got em in suede thongs
And they ass meat lookin like filet mignon
You can find me, back a da club I'm wylin
Shots in a mafuckan mug, I'm buyin
No I ain't a mafuckan thug, but I will cut a rug in this mafucka
Carpet violence
In the crib with dat AC on
No fib, ya girl up in a lacy thong
Cause the kid been known to make a racy song
Dicky got it goin on like I'm Stacy's mom
I'm higher than I ever been, flyer than a pelican
No lie see mo vagina than a common OBGYN
I'm ballin whatchu know bout that
In a purple charlotte throwback hat
And I merc these tracks when I heard this rap
Got me actin like I'm erkel, did I do that
Hell yeah I did, you know I do it
And the way they fallin for me like I'm boys with cupid
In a truck with a slut with a butt, get a nut,
Call that bitch bill buckner the way she blew it
I'm high off weed and oxycodon
I'm a caffeine fiend takin shots a soda
Wish I was big pimpin on a yacht with Hova
But I'm happy that ma girl lemme motorboat her
I make this shit look easy dude
I spit dat sick dat sneeze achu
And who knew that baddest was a
Nappy headed greasy Jew
[Hook: Lil Dicky]
Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Lil Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Sicker than the holocaust

Concentration camp cold
Now we rollin in that mothafuckin dough

Lil Dicky spit that Jewish flow
Sicker than the holocaust
Dat muthafuckin jewish flow
That Auschwitz sick, gas chamber kinda shit
Now I got german bitches all up on ma dick
Das dat jewish flow
Blowin up, you know that's DI
Flowin since ya boy was knee high
Now I'm grown up and ya'll buggin cause I'm buzzin like a beehive
Shout out to my city, Philly, big ups to PA
I went to college in VA but now I'm chillin by the bay
And I got ma shit on lock, cause I ball like a jock
They attached to my balls, like a small little cock
No bullshit, dicky do it big no doubt
And ya girl in the whirpool, wet no draught
And she get so loud, I be like slow down
Lemme relish this shit girl, no kraut
And then I beat that like it was a title bout
And then I plant my seed that ho got plowed
Ew you so nasty, lil dicky you so nasty
I got green knees, why you keep yo crib so grassy
I do it how I do it baby swag out the ass
And I'm shittin on you dick heads like a drag the asshooole
Don't cha know my girls DTF
And they pretty damn fine das PDF
I'm a open that, I'm a cum press that
I got Adobe Acrobat
Ma homies say that pussy takes a toll on dudes
But my EZ pass dick just slides right through ooo
You know that dicky bout to bubble up
Fresha than a mothafuck
I gotta gang a bitches, whatchu know about a cluster fuck
The back of the crack of that ass is poking outcha pants
I'm a crack from the back and ejaculate all on that ass
N'amsayin I'm cool ass mafucka try to see me
If you want ma life, better find a genie
In the club tryna choose, but I'm bein greedy
So you know I pick six like a deion TD
Cause I got that swag that y'all don't have
Is that yo girl, das ma bad
The sickest shit out two lips, heavy flow, I spit vagina flaps
And y'ain't even want it with da boy
Cause the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I.
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude
Shit, I'm living good up in this bitch
Dicky rollin round the city, blowin good up in that wip
I ain't black or Dominican, not Hispanic or Indian
So imprisonment is not a predicament, I envision
For a white boy
Hollatcha muthafuckin kike, boy
Higher than a muthafuckin kite, it's iight boi
They ain't suspicious of jews
I'll show contrition it's cool
Slap on the wrist, get ma daddy to choose
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise
Das what I do kid
Happy that my name ain't stupid
Dave coulda been Daquan with a few kids
But now I'm farting, overeating at meals,
If ain't I gotta theme party, Ion't be at goodwill
I'm dentist paying, tennis playing, smellin on some cabernet
And I ain't gay but if I was, everything would be okay, look...
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes
But ma premium channels mean tyler perry's never live
Getting tickets, they sick, I sit at the eagle 45
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive food chainssss
Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho
Happy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up
Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka
They up in heels
And tummy tuckin, theyon't grub except for takin them pills, foreal...
And ion't bleach shit
Ion't gotta eat dick
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis
Smoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing
In disagreements, I participate without weeping
And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that
Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut
So what up
Ya boy cut up
But eat butter
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother... to still love her
And I been getting better looking with age
But a guy can get who he deserves with a horrible face
Seal interlude
I go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake
And if impregnate I can pack a back and be on my way, but good luck girl!
Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man
First off I'm a dude so
There was a one in two chance of that sucking
But now I can run a seven minute mile
I can defend my self adequately
I can be logical
I can get along with my room-mates
Watch serious movies without being scared by them
And the on top of that I'm white
Which is like, amazing because
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country
I get my hair cut at a salon
People hold the door open for me which is nice
Er, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people
It ain't about that
It's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying
But on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense
I've been thinking about that shit a lot
Because like if I could say the N-word, it would really help my rhyme scheme out
It's like the perfect filler word
Eh this gon' be the shit that when motherfuckers hear it
They gon' be like 'Damn, that dude can rap'
Know what I'm saying
Like, like, like, like
Look, I'm the man bro
Iont really care what the fuck you think
Steak look rare but I grub dat pink
And the grundle stink
And I bump N-sync
Don't suck dick, but I blow dat good
Don't want shit but a ho that would
Lemme hold dat, bend and fold that
Get a Kodak, cowboy, Jerry Jones dat, lemme own that
Word... fuck that girl
Jew got hair, never cut them curls
Truth or dare with a cute au paire
Get a room to share, hit a boom, Pat Burrell
Spit dat turd, das dat shit
Gotcha girl up on ma dick
I'm bout to sperm up on dem hips
Don't wanna murder us a kid
Oh shit... whatchu say
Don'tchu do this erry day
Don'tchu usually go with double meat when you eat chipotle
Don't your crew lack someone black, but you want one to hang no slave
And I heard your boo got so much back like she bangin' that Notre Dame clock
Faded tho.
Fuckin bitches you'd label undateable
Missing birthdays, hay belated brah
Naked out in san fran on that rooftop

Dat vagina fitted custom for humpin dis little dicky
Puffin' sticky while she bangin' on my wood
Superstitious, pussy good
Cooter vicious, within a minute I finished
But I ain't trippin off no quick nut
And no pain in the butt, ma shit's tough
And ma dick's sucked, and yo dick sucks
But real talk I could never give an inch up
We tippin cups in the strip club, no flip cup
With a fit butt rubbin on my Nike zip up
No whisenhunt, but them bad bitches get cut
Gotta get up so the dick tucked

Wearing out a lotta boxes on the road
Word to plaid
And I gotta have my pops no cereal

Bumpin to something usher, while grubbing on some fuddruckers

You can get retarded, but lil dicky think he stayin home

Goin fifth grade with it, Dicky opening snacks
Because the kid made different like a joke in Iraq
Now check it
Never thought I wanna pass the bar
But I gotta get fancy car
So I got up on the beat, beat on it like
Evander sparring partner, smarter art
When I master bars
These weak bitches gotta leave, dicky dissin' em all

The dude's so bright, I'm rapping like a sumo fight
The knee slappin' unexpected, word to Juno's tike, I'm out.
Man I wish I was a kid
Thinking bout the third grade
Back in '96 in my Michael Jordan jersey
French fries curly, cool with it, raising Tamagachis
Dick 3 and a half, the same as a floppy
Nerf guns loaded and we shootin at y'all motherfuckers
We ain't getting hoes, but we getting soda
And we was fucking with the swag of The Fresh Prince
Ain't nothing like when you had mad tokens left
In that arcade balling
Watching tickets falling
Pegging stupid bitches in the motherfucking ball pit
Landline calling
Chilling at the mall
And if this the type of shit that you recall well then
Let me hear you shout
If you grew up in the 90's
Then you know what I'm about
Don't you wish we could rewind it
I wish we could, man I really miss it
Cause we having fun all day
Slept all night
Best ten years of our whole damn lives
Blowing on a cartridge, a lot of fucking farting
I would give it all up, if I could restart it
Sitting on the school bus
Flipping through some Goosebumps
A minute 'til I'm shitting out the school lunch
Wanna know what cool was
Starter jackets, Jock jams, and Pop Rocks
Sega in my room, baby boom shaka laka
Lot of slammers in my pocket, flippin them pogs
And I knew every modem noise in ma aol login
On that Oregon Trail
With Keenan & Kell
I was jerkin off daily, TRL
But that Saved by the Bell
Was on some fuckin hot shit
OJ to jail, oh wait that glove did not fit
Short shorts Stockton
Beanie Baby profits
And NBA on NBC if you remember watching
Remember getting greeted with Scholastic mags
I hated it reading but it made me need that shit so bad
And we was spinning that bottle, de-prude hoes
Winning full throttle, Nintendo
Switch the flow up, getting donuts
Fruit roll ups, wishing we could be a grown up
Being so dumb, fucking with the kid, call me Lil Dicky Griffey
And my koosh balls big, man I think I had 50
Love those mentos ads
There were ten boy bands
I had ten ring pops on my hands
Plus I love that Nick at Nite nighttime
Kicks had lights
Shine brighter than some tights when they was tag team fighting
Shout out to Topanga
Fuck you know about Jenga
Best head ever from a Pez dispenser

So good riddance, to every rapper acting so cool with it
I school bitches, but still I'm acting a fool with it
So fuck all the tools with they stupid ass music but...
Lot of rappers talking that shit, not enough doing that shit
Y’know I’m sayin’ Yeah
People acting like I ain’t a fucking criminal
Like I ain’t never doing dirt though
Probably cause the way I’m doing shit is clinical
But I’ve been putting in some work, breh
I see you looking at me cynical, stop looking at me
I ain’t fucking with your smirk ho
We’ve been doing shit, despicable
But we just keep it on a low, for example
Walk in to the movie with my pants full
Twix, bag of chips, plus a Snapple
Stealing all the shampoos, from the hotel’s pretty bathrooms
Cheating, I’ve been peekin’ in the classroom
Looking like a nice guy, ‘til I take your motherfucking Wi-Fi
And torrent every single song in my library
Then I drive by very fucking high by everybody
While my lady licking my five inch dick
White crime
White crime
Yeah, we ‘bout that
Do a lot of dirt, never doubt that
Lot of rap twerps, let it shout crap
Let it make their mouth flat
When it come to burd, no, we spout facts
You 'gon learn what I’m 'bout, breh
[Verse 2:]
Doing business at the airport
Ask security, I ain’t fraught
Lot of shit up in my JanSport
Six ounce of the face wash the limit three
My duffle bigger than what can board
My shuffle on during take-off
Will I help in an emergency Yeah, sure
Exit row, fingers straight crossed
Thinking Dave’s soft
But I know you see me J-walking
Piss in public, no caution
Halloween bucket Take one, fuck you thinkin’ Dave was
Give me all your motherfucking chocolate, ho
At the stop sign, never fully stopping though
Filling water cups up, with a lot of coke
Egging homes, motherfucker, a lot of yolk
Not alone up in this motherfucker, a lot of folks, been doing…
Even though the speeding limit sixty five
I’m doing seventy five without a seat belt on
And I’ve been texting, driving reckless
I was seventeen when I first tried a Guiness on the tennis team
We used to haze a lot of freshmen
Lil Dicky put a hoop up in the street
Without obtaining permission
From the city, and every Christmas day
I’m going to cinemas with single tickets to single flicks
But go to additional pictures, sorry, but your boy is malicious
And back when I was eighteen, statutory raping
This little ho, even though we was dating
And if I am taking public transportation
On the quiet train I might have a conversation
Fuck it I’m the man
Puitting trash up in some other people’s cans though
At the work fridge, stealing can coke
And up at the holiday party, I’m grinding colleagues on the dance floor
Dick been rubbing against their assholes, say it’s not…
Drunk, faded, browned out, looking all shady
Two months since I fucked a lady, young man dick going crazy
Standard Saturday, I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
Then I see a hot girl, look back at Dave
Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway
That's what I thought not what I said to her
Instead I walk up to her, like I know you heard of the kid
You heard what I did, you heard of my shit, the murderous spit.
She's like, Naw, you're being weird, what are you talking about
I'm like, Aw...
Pulling out my phone, like a boss, YouTube 'bout to get her off
But as I type the y-o-u, some porno pop up
I'm like, Hold up, how did, that's not even me
Like, I don't jerk off mobily...
Then her friends coming up
And wanna know if everything is okay
I'm like, Naw, this a rape, you can't tell
Gimme a break, please. Get the heck away.
I turned to her, Let me buy you a drink, she like, Fine.
Told the man, Two Patron, she like, Lime.
Said he tried twice, the card got declined
I'm like, All ri-, is this a, could it be a machine issue
He was like, Naw,
I was like, Obviously there's something wrong
I got dough, like I'm not broke...
I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago.
He like, Dude, I don't know.
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
And I ain't talking 'bout with me, bro, I mean alone
I got one more chance to prove myself, so I'm like
Look, I'm athletic, girl, I've gotten several Rec League MVP's
At my crib I've got some pizza, plus a little bit of weed
In my room I've got a TV, plus I recently did sheets
Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door
Like with the crushed ice
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak
The girl from the first verse, somehow let me fuck
Fast forward, seven months, we in love
Some real serious relationship type shit
Despite this, I ain't fucked for days
Tried last night, but was pushed away
But I've been acting well behaved today, I smell okay
Adele Pandora's playing, now she laying
On the floor and I'm praying this bitch is horny
I go and give her a smooch
She kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs
Bad move, she don't like that
Bad mood, her boss being mean to her
Via email, she wanna write back
I'm like, Right now
She like, Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me
Oh, okay, what's the context
Then she like, Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me.
Who's Jane again I said, she like, Wow, you should know that...
Okay, I guess I forgot, she like, Dude, that's my other boss.
Okay, true, so shouldn't your first boss
Go to the other boss, before you Right
But Jane isn't hands on! she yelled
Okay, well I just don't understand the dynamic then
I don't work with these people. She started crying
Wait stop, what the fuck is this
Naw, you don't ever take my side.
About an hour later til' I'm on her good side
We in bed, hands on her good thighs
I try to kiss, she like, Good night but I'm like
Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee
I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing and weed
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet
And supportive aunt during the fourth quarter, of the Eagles
Now reward it..
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak
Fast forward some more, June sixteenth, twenty seventy four
Old LD looking old as fuck, still with the same ho, holding up
But my life sucks, legs hurt, friends dead, real terse
My dick looking like it's tinfoil
Her tits looking like they hard boiled eggs
On top of that, she insane
Like, I don't even think she knows who I am
Our kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days
Maybe months, who knows, probably going to die soon
Pretty scared, I ain't even gonna lie to you
Think about it all day, on my last legs
But I'm going out with a bang
I got pills they invented back in fifty seven
I took five, that's a bit excessive
I look high, take a look at my thighs
And good god that's a little erection, it'll work though
Now I've gotta find the ho, I'm pretty much blind at this point
I don't know if I mentioned that yet, but I am
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is, I'm like
Look, I don't know if you're aware that
You've been throwing out my shoes
What I do know is, I'm sick of doing nothing here with you
All my blood is in my dick, I'm probably dying pretty soon
Are you even comprehending what I'm saying
Please acknowledge that you hear me...
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak
Yeah. Man, this is the softest thing I ever did.
But... it's about something that's pretty important to me...
And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore,
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight
Make a young couple do something sad like,
Being broke up even though we had life.
Fuck it, I don't even know what I could have done
Looking back thinking, That's what I should've done.
Wanted you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come.
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong.
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs
And she know them pretty soon when your dude on
Running the rap game, with that lane.
Always got to be up on that train, or that plane
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain, or that strain
Wishing I ain't gotta get that fame
Or I'd claim you, know I'd give you my last name.
But that blame on me
Chasing something, feeling dumb 'cause you all I need.
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free,
But you know I'm never knowing when that's gonna be
And I'm sorry.
It's the hardest rule to follow I'm thinking of you
I really wish that I could call you What can I do
You can find another me tomorrow,
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.
If I woke up and I called it quits 'cause I'm thinking of you
If today I gave up all of this I don't know what to do
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.
And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore,
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight
Make a young couple do something sad like,
Being broke up even though we had life.
When I'm being dumb and stupid
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfucking jerk face
Who's gonna let me know to hit my mother on her birthday
Who's gonna let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay
And when I'm on the road I be missing that.
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap.
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinking back
Listening to you auto-tune in my mic phone making us laugh.
You know the past was a blast but it never could last.
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny
Doing nothing's never nothing when it's something with you.
You know I wanna still talk, even text and call
Whenever something going on I be pressing Moll
Up in the phone til I press the X
Stressed the next one'll best the ex,
And you'll forget, but it's best.
You the best to me girl, always bake me something
And when they ripped off, you replaced my buttons.
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband,
'cause even when I can't say, Love you,
I love you
It's the hardest rule to follow I'm thinking of you
I really wish that I could call you What can I do
You can find another me tomorrow,
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.
If I woke up and I called it quits 'cause I'm thinking of you
If today I gave up all of this I don't know what to do
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.
And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore,
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight
Make a young couple do something sad like,
Being broke up even though we had life.
It's the hardest rule to follow I'm thinking of you
I really wish that I could call you What can I do
You can find another me tomorrow,
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.
If I woke up and I called it quits 'cause I'm thinking of you
If today I gave up all of this I don't know what to do
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.

Damn you got money, but damn I got flow
Damn you got riches, damn you got clothes
Damn you got honeys but damn I got soul

I been packing the band-wagon, the man cracking
The man packing the stands, had them clapping they hands
Tagging they ‘grams, Manhattan was ham
Slapping the fans, playing havin' the plan

These bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew

Twice as in double as fuckable as he was
And dude tries to be subtle and get her cuddling
Venting her troubles and getting her truffles and ending up
Befuddled when she don't fuck him and someone tell him listen
You bugging she never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you
So why all the trouble but he rebuttal with
I think I just love her so I would shudder at the thought
Of being anything other than nice

I'm all time like the Wall at the Bank
You've no shot like you drawing a blank
Honestly you probably couldn't hang man

Giving you lines while you sitting there and drawing a blank
So go in the rink, chilling like it's dough in the bank
And I’m flowing danker than a grower in Napa
Growing the stankest cannabis
Doing rap and pro-est smacking the hoe-est rappers
And showing the total package like my flaccid is growing fatter
Samoan cracker dapper rapper had to keep goin

Just don't know how to react to the forces
I should have just thanked you of course-
Uh, why would you thank me 
Uh... I guess I assumed it would extend to the families but okay
While we on the topic
I been actually thinking about some shit
About the Army and Navy
What if tomorrow is the day
That the fucking aliens came
And invaded our nation
Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit
Like do we got the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships
Or not at all, like would they just walk up in this motherfucker
Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us
And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate
Without a hint of intimidation
Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race
Granted I don't know the alien heart, but
You get what the fuck I'm sayin
Like what the fuck would it be like
Would they be like Earth go hard
Or is it just another conquest
Or would they be like damn earth go hard
They was harder than Simian
You ever talk to your brother about this uh type of stuff
Then she like No
I'm like Well, what you think
She like I don't concern myself with hypotheticals that couldn't be
I'm like Girl, what you mean
She like I don't believe
In the war
In aliens
Oh... hold up
Hold up, wait
Girl what you sayin
That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand
I guess
What an enormous coincidence that shit would be
Do you see what I'm sayin'
I can't hear what you're sayin'
Well, the universe always expanding
There are infinite galaxies
Why would we be the anomaly
She like That's no coincidence
I call that shit God
I'm like Oh, you're religious, bitch
You think it's all God
No, I know it's all God
No, I know that there might be a God
First off, nobody knows there's a God
Girl, I think we should drop this
No, what's goin' on in your brain right now
Brain Ayy, brain on some other shit though
I been all up in the club for the year, hey Brain
I been killing shit, don't mind me
I'm just top flight, I could sure use a Sprite, I'm thirsty as fuck
Who getting money That's brain. Who make decisions That's brain
Who make the hits That's been brain
Who run the whole operation
That be brain-
Brain, can you just get back to the issue here
Uh, can you just remind the brain
You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if he exists
Don't call brain names
The brain couldn't recall
But if I'm not mistaken this bitch to my left
Guaranteed there's a God
I believe in a God, yes
So God never wrong
God never wrong, right
Yeah, that's like the whole point
Brain just get there, please
Hold up
So God made the earth
And God was like hold up, this shit is boring
It need more shit
God was like I'ma put dinosaurs on that bitch
Dinosaurs on that bitch
Then he like why I put dinosaurs on that shit
What is your brain even saying
Can he get to the point
Hold up brain you just did it
God ain't wrong, what the fuck was he thinking
About what 
Bitch, the dinosaurs
He made the Earth for them
But then he like nah
Dinosaurs are just blah
What's your point
I'ma cook up some blondes
Like he was way off
I don't look like a dinosaur
Hoe them things thirty-five-feet
I'm like five-foot-eleven Up on Tinder I'm six-foot
Seen that Bronchiosaurus
That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven
And that's just an expression bitch
There ain't no heaven
Ha, funny
I'm just messin' but if he ain't wrong
I guess this the exception
Can I talk now
Go ahead
Look
Everything in life has purpose
You, chickens, a midget at a circus
What
I don't interpret
She like That's not for me to determine
So dinosaurs purpose was to just die
That's not for me to determine
But... ok
I'm just a person
Okay, but think of the root of the argument girl
View how we started this girl, like you don't believe in the aliens
You confine God to earth girl, I find that shit salient
I just don't presume to know the plan
Bitch, me neither but that's not what I've been saying
But what are you saying
Why can't God fuck with aliens
Why can't Earth just be like a fucking small side project for this guy
Ok, look we just don't see eye to eye
Yeah but logically like you don't believe in your side
Yeah but you're like bringing up fucking dinosaurs
Like we could have shared the earth with them nobody knows
Yeah, there is hard soil evidence girl
Like what's next you don't fuck with Pangaea
She like Let's change the subject
Ok...
This bitch don't know about Pangaea, uhm...
Brain leave it alone
I'm starving, are you hungry by chance
Oh, my God, I'm so hungry
Yes, do you wanna get a pizza
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, I'm on it
Also I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing
Come on dude I'm a grown up

Okay, I just... fuck it
Okay back to this pizza I lean pepperoni
Ugh
Sausage

This legit, is high quality meat and shit
No, no, I'm vegetarian
Oh right, well we can get half pepperoni
And half of whatever you like
Uh, ew, I can't have that shit
In the same box
Seriously You're that against meat
No, I'm that against us being gluttonous
Thinking that animals live on this earth to get eaten
Okay, is it how we treat them
Uh, that sure doesn't help
Ok...
She like I'm not opposed to us hunting
But now we not trackin' them down
We just breed them to eat
That's disgusting
You should honestly read on the subject
Alright, hold up
Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow
Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens
We just set the place to do our hunting intelligently enough
To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want
That's my point we just incubate animals
Instead of just letting them live how they come
But, that's just your God at work, bitch
Why we go hard on earth
What you think would happen right now
If you left my place
And there were like three wolves waiting for you
Wolves
Bitch, they would tear your ass up
Viciously
Like they would eat your titties And your pussy
That's what they do And your face and shit
Humans are smarter bitch
That's what we do
She like Apples to oranges
Bitch, that phrase don't make no sense
Why can't fruit be compared
She like I'm gonna leave
There's just all of these conflicting principles
Right, enjoy your pepperoni pizza
I will, that's my God-given right
She like Where is my bag
Oh, that leather one next to the trash
That's the one right Made out of cow, I think
Ugh why are there no Ubers in this area
So you don't eat the meat, you just be wearing the shit
I'm not listening dude
That's barbaric as shit
Do you come from the vikings
Why are you even still talking
Do you take peoples land
I'm not listening dude
Do you fuck with the war
How are there no Ubers anywhere
Just download Lyft, they are bigger in presence out here
I don't wanna add shit to my phone
Okay, the choices are clear, hoe
Ubers are not around here at all
Taxis will come but they real slow
And the brain gotta poop
T minus five till the brain gotta shit
I just downloaded Lyft, but it's being so glitch
Uh, look do you just want to sleep here
Uh, no thanks
It's past 2 am
I'm not sharing a bed with you
You can sleep in my bed, I'll just sleep on the floor
Fine, you're sure
Yeah, it's cool
I won't throw you out to the wolves
Oh, my God, you are so annoying
I couldn't help myself
But can you at least throw me a pillow
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy Do you fuck with the war
I just finished spazzing on a bitch, ayy
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch
Brain gotta poop still
Please don't neglect the brain
Please don't neglect the brain

Hold on, is that my Lyft
Nah, I got a pizza
Full pepperoni too
So, you're not gonna wanna be a part of it
But first you should poop
Please don't neglect the brain
Yeah,
I feel like people are really weird about admitting, when they’re scared
If you’re not scared ever, you’re just lying or something
You’re being weird
Ten days in the bay left
And I don’t mean to overthink that
Got a one way straight to L.A.X
And I ain’t blink yet
I know you’d think that
I’d of figured out this whole thing
Like where his chink at
Segue to Lil Dicky getting bigger than a Yao Ming
But can I shrink that
Where my shrink at
I don’t know what to feel
Everything has gotten totally real
Everything I always wanted right in front of me with nobody near
So it’s weird that I’m overly scared
But I’m so unprepared
Holding the beer, I’m withholding the fear
Not in the clear but I’m kind of revered
And yeah I might appear like the chill type
The veneer is not real in the real life
What it feel like
Thanks giving I was missing I ain’t even miss ‘em
Girlfriend hella distant I ain’t even listen
Only shit I really care about is spittin’ writtens
This is the beginning
I’m just getting into the game
My world’s not spinning the same
The shit looking like it’s bigger than Dave
It’s so crazy
But when all this sitting at stake
I can’t break, even if I’m afraid it might change me
Look if you let me
You know I could get deep
Baby hope you ready
I’m coming through
Running you
That’s what I do
Just know that it’s all for you
So what you gonna choose
Afraid to say okay
And I know I’m not gonna get in the way
But I’m afraid
Who I wanna be is what I became
But I’m ashamed
Ain’t no coming back
Facing what I wanted but it’s all fucking weird
At night I’m really scared
I ain’t made from the projects
But you know I treat the game like a project
So you know it’s not the same kind of progress
Different process, but I digress
Other rappers didn’t blow overnight
They ain’t had a nine to five that was totally right
They was all up on the grind from the moment they write
At twenty five, hadn’t even done a show in my life
It’s like, damn, I’m a rapper, how did that happen
I was making ads then, back when
Only used to rapping to my Mac then
Packed venues came through like shoot let’s practice
Tryin' tell you I ain’t bred for this shit
Despite that, feeling like I’m meant for this shit
But like that, everything depends on this shit
And I ain’t betting against it
But I ain’t had a moment to reflect what I’m betting against it
I’m next even though it’s pretentious I sense it
Relentless, but it leave me defenseless
I guess I should learn to accept it, but it’s hectic
Oh you want a condensed list
I’m worried that I’m about to give my all to it, hundred percent
You ain’t gotta know it all to discover what’s left
Pretty fucking intense
And I worry that I got a lotta gall when it come to success
Telling y'all this a hundred percent
But what happens if I fall short of what I call the surest of bets
Cause what’s a hundred percent
What’s a hundred percent
Is that it take a lot to make me content
And I’m ‘bout to chase around a legend that I fucking invented
While I’m neglecting everybody that I love and respected
Because I hate the thought of coming in second
And I don’t want to do no second guessing when it come to progressing
Because I really couldn’t stomach regretting my effort
When I’m at the end and I’m assessing if I could of done better
I better be able to be it or never
Or be the best ever
But if somehow I’m really that special
Then I’m about to deal with mad pressure
I fear that when I finish my assessment I'mma be in depression
Because I’ll see a lot of me as regressing
It’s obvious to me to be the best a lot of me is repressing itself
I wonder what I’ll see in reflections
I wonder if I’ll run into a woman cool with coming in second
Or if I’m bound to be the fool at the weddings
Alone and regretting the whole thing
Now you’re seeing why it’s so big
What would y'all do, if y'all were the old me
Get involved and you gotta give the whole thing
This is no fling, this devoting
Every mother fucking part of yourself
No matter what ever the cards you was dealt
You going all in
I don’t know about y'all but I’m gone
And I don’t know if I’m ballin' or bawling
Look if you let me
You know I could get deep
Baby hope you ready
I’m coming through
Running you
That’s what I do
Just know that it’s all for you
So what you gonna choose
Afraid to say okay
And I know I’m not gonna get in the way
But I’m afraid
Who I wanna be is what I became
But I’m ashamed
Ain’t no coming back
Facing what I wanted but it’s all fucking weird
At night I’m really scared
Hello, how can I help you
Hi, my name's Dave Burd. I have an appointment today. it's probably under 'Lil Dicky, ' actually. I'm a... I'm a rapper, so...
Ok, and who are you here to see
Uh, Snoop Dogg Says here Snoop D-o-g-g.
Oh, yeah. He's right down the hall. First door to your right. Give him a knock and he should be right with you.
Thanks. It's uh, this door right here, right
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Grab a seat
Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make
I can't lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there's a reason that we called, Dave
Let me start with your background
Where you come from
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking bout my hometown
Yeah
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much
I wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I'm cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don't diss me buddy, I wasn't one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must've wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there's something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap
Oh my God, it's the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It's never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It's kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn't do shit
And I don't even get what that got to do with this
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that's my niche!
Don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed
That's the target I'll hit
And that's the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don't know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don't mean any disrespect by that
I'm just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant
So what are your biggest strengths
Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain't nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer
Alright, alright, I get it
Top of that, lyrically I'm pretty damn clever Go
Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville Whoa
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee Oh
You can say I'm pretty smart how I know better
And y'all been winning like Pistorius, there's no feet.
Bro, I can go on and on
I'm taking over any man like father in laws
OK enough of the punchline, that ain't showing me you different from the other guys
Well I don't know if they can run it like that
But ain't nobody else doing funny type rap
What's that
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you
I don't get it
Nah it ain't like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like it's a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain't finna just lie
Real recognize real, right
Yeah, I guess
So what you trying to do
Five years from now, tell me bout the dude
Well, I don't care about the money
Like, it's the respect that I'm wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats,
For they gotta bring ya boy every debate.
I don't wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell, what's your legacy
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain't gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain't mad at that
Well thanks, man, that's my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I'm a rap the plaques
And I ain't about to win them back to back
I'm bout to win them like it's back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain't even sold a damn album yet
True
That's a lot of talk from a wiley vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain't a book nigga
Well that's one of my flaws, I'm too competitive dawg
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it, you trying to be better than all
But you ain't shit until cheddars involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain't done shit
But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I'm like this
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don't know if it's your worst shit
You don't think finding out would be worth it
It might be, it might not
But I'm a put your ass to work, kid
Wait, like, like I have the job Like really
Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together
What would you do for the hook for this song
You want me to make a hook up right now
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself
Alright, uh, okay
Man do the hook!
I'm bout to be professional
Homie, I'm professional
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing
Nigga, that shit is garbage man
Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I'm not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don't y'all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes
Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there
Yeah, you know, I'm just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt
Right now
Yeah
Sure
Dope. Juanita, bring some weed in here, please. Thank you
You got it, Snoop. I'll be right there.
Thanks, Juanita. Super nice woman
Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft
Uh, I really don't wanna be spoken to like that, so...
Whatever. Thanks
Hey, I got y'all y'all weed.
Damn, that's some great looking weed. It's just so early
Can I get you guys anything else while I'm here Coffee Tea Head Bottled water
D-Did you just say head
Yeah. You ain't never got no head before
I mean... Just feels like... A lot, right now
Ok.
But what kind of tea do you guys have
We got mint, raspberry, earl grey, english breakfast...
Actually, I'll take head
I knew your little dirty ass wanted some head.
A.k.a the Time Traveler's Wife
s I like to play it cool like I'm not that
On the low, who'd assume that I got that
I don't know, but the dude with the tall frappe
Looking all aloof being all that
Even Babe Ruth wouldn't call that
I don't even sweat it though
They been hesitant as if my credit low
And shit'll hit them quicker than an edible
I'm 'bout to run for Senate ho, you ain't even centerfold
Been on top of cheese, I ain't talking 'bout oregano
I'm talking 'bout your cheddar homie, revel in that
I'll hit a college and I'm fucked, like I'm pledging a frat
They 'bout to silhouette my nuts on American flags
Estoy contento, muy estupendo
Better hearse word to rent-a-car, Dicky Tony K
Y'all the Le Batard speaking to you lames, that's a seminar
I'm straight like a pleasant bar, ain't nobody ready for my repertoire
I wasn't getting credit like a debit card
But never mind, had to give them time to adapt
I'm kind of like a rap rendition of a fry in a wrap
Just try it as that
You rappers Rebel Wilson's vagina, you stank!

And bro they used to
Look around the boy, wouldn't raised they head

Now they look at me like Who knew, who knew
Now it's Dicky with this, who knew, who knew

You might get killed thinking that he all polite
Buzz around the city, coming out of Philly
I'm about to get a milli, being me that's word to milli
I'm looking super silly, but cooking like at Chili's
You look at me like Really but I look at you like Who that
Oh you new here, I'm the bomb
Ok I'm Lebron, ok I'm the one
Ok all that shit confusing that's a quandry
What you call a pussy with a movement, that's a Ghandi
I'm tryna get better but science preventing
Because I'm undeniably clever, the highest of levels
I'm high in a sweater but rhyming like I'm lying in pepper
Don't mind the endeavor, I bet I do better than veterans
Cheddaring, let him on Letterman
Get him on L and I'm on, boy
I think I need a therapist the way I get in my dome
Doing D like they was Syracuse, when they up in they zone
Used to load it on chrome, now I really ball
Living like a fucking letter man, never mailing the song
Though the dime flow rubbing combos in Tom's shoes
With blonde hoes getting Peyton like the Broncos
I'm on ho, vanilla looking but the rest of y'all the John Does
It's pretty odd bro, cause they used to
Look around the boy, wouldn't raised they head
Now they looking at the boy like the main event
He don't even got a rap sheet, looking like a mathlete
How the fuck is he the one that come in with the crack

If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing along like
Oh don't double charge for me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Oh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it take a minute let it breathe B
But think about it bruh you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Vs. the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'm a get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kyke know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident
You didn't even mean that [snicker]
You didn't... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed
Oh well, I'm ignorant
But not to the fact that I'm ignorant, of course
I know that, I'm indifferent
I don't care to know what I don't
I don't care 'til I'm coming home
And my dad tell me some shit about when he my age, he was doing shit
Protesting about something that I forget currently
But that's not the point, the point is
To my pot, the boy is in the crowd devoid of giving a fuck
I would call his bluff but I've been thinking 'bout it
And shit, he ain't wrong, though
I don't vote but I think I did at prom, though
I don't know about a world if it's not home
I don't even know the first thing about what Obama do
I'm better off telling y'all what Lebron been doing
I don't even know what my mom been doing
I hit her up every Sunday
And we talk, but the call's going one way
In the dark, if it's not what I'm doing
Never been aware from the start, but I knew it
I don't even care how my tech work
If the shit work, put it there, turn it on, we can do it
Funny thing is I could look it all up today
Constructive way to buck behavior Dave hate
And placate the debate within my brain waves
But the shows I watch all start at 8 so
Oh well
It's the season finale, so...
Oh well
I kind of have to watch live, people are gonna tweet about it
Oh well
But I'm aware of all this stuff, I'll figure it out
Oh well
I do care when my phone's dying
Like, when that shit's red and I can't text
And I can't check what my fans said
I get mad stressed
Laying in the bed but I can't rest
Till my gram checked, wish I cared less
Leave it at the crib, I'm a damn mess
I should stop for a day, wanna try that shit
Drifting away, I wanna ride that ship
Dinner on the table but I'm unable to be tasteful
Underneath, I'm a like that pic
Watching the show on a phone, filming Coachella on phones
Hoping I capture the moment so I could post it
Don't live in the moment, hoping I'm still in control
But I'm praying I'm not alone
All the fans say I'm great at talking to 'em
They don't even understand I am not the man
I just can't go a day with being alone
When I'm with friends, though, why the fuck am I still on my phone
Wishing I could look this shit up on Chrome
Wishing I could take a second to stop and reflect it
But someone just texted me
[Hook 2 - Lil Dicky:]
Oh well
It's actually like an important text
Oh well
I'm trying to solve, like, logistical issues
Oh well
It's time sensitive is what I'm trying to say
Oh well
[Verse 3 - Jace:]
I was gonna do a line, but I sneezed
I was gonna smoke, but I need weed
I just wanna roll up and then leave
But everyone keeps on talking to me
Like How's Mike Will You know Rae Sremm
I like No Type but I really hate them
Like I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is
I'm passed through and through on loans and my rent
But I just bought new J's and shit
Going way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them
My mom says I should go back to classes
But I'm in the strip club and I'm clapping asses
And my bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis
But she lies a lot and can't kick the habit
I've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards
And they give two cents when I ain't even ask them
Treat them like exams and I need to pass them
I'm twitching dutches, I don't do the backwoods
But this gas station don't carry those
And I'm tryna smoke, man, how traffic
Here's a 20 and some change, man, you can have it like
No
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
What's up, y'all
It's your boy LD
A.K.A. The Original Pancake
I'm going the fuck out tonight
Off work, 'bout to get trashed
Me and my crew all about to get ass
Sam coming through with a bottle of the Cap
Me and Dean 'bout to tube, Mark taking out the trash
Clean up my room, bitches 'bout to peep that
Peeing, getting groomed, bitches 'bout to eat that
Dean shave my neck, thanks, man, I need that
Read through my text, then I itch my kneecap
Now I gotta play the game right with Liz
Top prospect, met the other night through Tinder
Eight o'clock so I think it's only right I hit her
With a what you got on tap for the night, delivered
While I wait Imma pick a shirt
Ain't nobody wearing plaid so I claim it first
Mark got a little sad cause his favorite shirt's plaid but fuck him
He knows I back off in a reverse
Now I'm taking a shot and we drinking and popping a bottle
And thinking of all the bitches we gon' haul in
Sam say I know a house party and it's popping
Bet Imma cop some weird head, Dennis Rodman
Oh, yeah, we plotting
This is a pregame
It's a pregame
A classic male pregame
Not a weekday
So this is when we take
Shots and we chasing alternate DJs
And that we pray cause
And we all get drunk
And we get dressed up
And we all buy gum
And we all gon' fuck
Aye, pour me another shot, God damn it
I'm tryna get to a place where I can talk to these bitches
I got seven shots in me, three condoms on me and immeasurable hope
Ten O Clock, words getting slurred
Another shot, Sam's tryna hurry
Mark's not, says he isn't worried
He ain't tryna spend hella bread at the clurb
Call him out, since when you using clurb, faggot
Mark pouts, something like a herb rabbit
Dean smiles, we been doing work
Pretty turnt, think he blacked out
Lil Dicky burp loud
Peep phone, what the fuck, she ain't text back
Pretty close to considering a text back
Spilling Coke on my shirt that's a red flag
Now I gotta change, Mark knows put his best plaid on
We debating the top ten in the NBA
Disagreeing alot about Lamarcus A
Shawshank Redemption popped on, attention all on
Sam was like, nah, the party called off
I already got a Lyft, I'm going out to a bar
Then Mark pulled out a spliff, temptation very hard
You know I couldn't resist, we blazing, now the car here
And we get fucked up
And we all feel rushed
And our plans fall through
And we in bad moods
Man, what time is it
12:24 And the bars close at 2, lights on like 1:30
Let me just think for like a second
Sam like, we gotta go, cause the car here
Mark like, I don't know, what's the bar deal
Dean like, I'm on a roll in Guitar Hero
Dicky looking like he about to choke on his lamb gyro
Sam looking let down, 'bout to go berserk
Mark put his sweats on, now he rolling purp
Dean blacked out, he ain't even on the earth
I was like, Sam, I was with it with my other shirt
Sam bounced, he's like, fuck it, I'm out
Me and Mark smoke a blunt, Dean stuck on the ground
Text Liz, what the fuck, even snuck in a frown
I get the spins high and drunk, I throw up in the shower
Now I'm jerking off inside a condom I do that
I text my ex say, I miss you often true that
Sam back, it's not even one yet, he a dumb mess
He about to be a problem
I ain't even tripping, I'm Tindering
All of a sudden I'm blinking, I'm squinting
It's saying it's six in the morning
I'm stinking, I'm still in the same shit from last night
Got a text from Mark saying:
I ain't mad, but I know you’ll clean the bath, right
And we get too drunk
And we don't have fun
Then we eat too much
And the next day sucks
Like, we really just wake up and spend far too much time shitting
So, the whole process just seems flawed
Thank you for your time
We ain't ever been the mother
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck
We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort
Just to show them that we better

For instance, I saw this nice looking young lady that I was attracted to sexually in the grocery part of Target.

Never even tried it, you know I ain't lying
Never even done cocaine
I've never even done cocaine
I never even tried it, never even tried it
Never even tried it, I've been close-minded
Party girl, party girl
Out in LA with a party girl
I was all good with Bacardi, girl
Now she tryin' to up the ante
I was kinda drunk and handsy
Johnson looking long like Randy
Hoping that my pitch is strong
Now she's like let's do some bumps
Ew, chill I don't do that Ew!
Poured a rail and she blew that
Now I'm scared, I look pussy
Spark the blunt 'cause I do that
She was sniffing that Tom Hanks
I was just sipping Chris Brown
She keep on sniffing that Zeus Coke
I keep my eyes on the ground
She like don't knock it 'till you try it
That's some bullshit yeah, I know
Just do a line of this Betsy Ross
I started thinking, can't deny I'm a pussy
Like as a child I was so dissmissive of the baked potato 'till I tried that shit
Now the baked potato is my favorite kind potato
Now she got me wondering what else I left on the table
Twenty-eight, I still ain't done no anal true
And I'm unusually skeptical
But man oh man this bitch was raw
So I asked her for some Molly
She like start with Miley

But I ain't trippin'
Balmain, Brain 'bout to get to kissing

I never even tried it, never even tried it that Ross Perot
Never even tried it, I've been close-minded Betty Boop
Ay, can y'all turn my headphones down Significantly
Cool, that's good
It was super loud
First of all, this shit about me
I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing
I've been waiting pretty long to get on some shit and rip it for Dicky
So just consider this my damn theme song, baby
I've been working hella hard, though
There's people telling me I'm 'bout to be a star, bro
But when I play 'em some of this, they like nobody want the piss, Lil Dicky
You the funny kid, that's where your card go
That metaphor about my lane, if your retardo
I'm bubbling like I'm in a soda, word to Fargo
I'm tryna get the fucking fame and it's a tricky little game you gotta play
Sometimes you gotta tell your heart No
Here's the problem I've been having
I wanna make my favorite type of music
And the shit I like to bump is not the type I'm brewing
I be on that Fuck the world, you motherfuckers losing type of shit
Like all you haters, look at what the fuck I'm doing
All my favorite rappers not amusing
And I love my funny stuff, I hope it's not confusing
I'm just saying, when you doing something time consuming
Every now and then you wanna spaz
Why I didn't go with jazz, muhfucka
Get up in yo ass, muhfucka
Y'all are trash, ye ain't even know the half
I could rattle off a lot of opposition to rap game
But honestly I'm not in the position for that plane
To carry any weight, I just gotta carry on and wait
'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight
Hypothetically, though, I prolly tell you that I'm better than your every bro
I prolly tell you it's subjective, I'm more impressive
You pressing play, a form of respective
I'm guessing more or less it won't be competitive
Y'all adorable, seditive kind of rappers, so deplorably editive
Nothing's worse than when a moron's repetitive
I don't get it, how is everyone the same dude
The rookie walking on the court like Man, I can't lose
They playing Dicky, everybody in the room be like That's some shit
Playing yo bum ass, they be like That's some shit
Y'all are bubbles with the rapping
Lil Dicky get it popping, you could say bubble rapping
The irony in all of this is I've been funny rapping
Yet the youngin's snapping to the point where all of y'all are funny rapping
Congratulations, y'all can write a hook
At my graduation, they was saying I could write a book
If a Rotten Tomatoes site existed for us rappers
I would be a 97, y'all would hover 'round a 64
Little Dicky spit that Pixar
Hope you seeing why I really like to spit hard
Only problem is I'm rapping at rappers
To the people that be listening, that world doesn't matter
Wanna know what the advantage of the rapper who black is
The N-word isn't antagonist
Before you get all huff and puff about, think about it, be analyst
The fact they always use it's no accident
For example, I could be like Go figure
I don't think I'm one to fuck with all you ho 
Y'all can fill in the blank
That don't make it so you don't gotta rap it a rapper
That applies to every detractor
But even if I had a word like  disturbed
It's absurd but I'm looking 'round and ain't nobody verse me
I don't think a motherfucker's ever tried to hurt me
Every one I see has been supportive on this journey
Like where my haters at I'm thirsty
I just really wanna talk my shit, be like Y'all ain't shit
But y'all ain't shit, like, y'all don't exist
I could talk about the people that are dicks but I feel like that's whack
That'll get old quick, Robin Williams in Jack
Who the fuck is my antagonist
Is it you Is it you
If it's you, let me tell you something
You ain't even got a clue 'bout the shit that's coming
You don't wanna be the dude in five years like
The fuck, I dissed that
Shit was pretty clear, how the fuck I missed that
You know that I ain't fucking light, bruh
I just fucked round and did this overnight, bruh
I just fucked around and quit a fucking job 
where I was making triple digits then the comma got involved, dawg
This wasn't rapping or trapping
This was rapping over a big ol' fucking house with a family
Who the fuck is listening  but making Dicky so angry
Is it you Is it you
I'm just waiting on some nonbelievers
The writing isn't on the wall, it's coming out your speakers
Anybody disagree, I'm being so facetious, homie I mean it
Forget the website, I'm the only motherfucking rap genius
Where you doubters at, I'm tryna hear it
Maybe it's the motherfuckers never paying mind to lyrics
I would dumb it down for y'all to try make it more appealing
But the ones who hang on every word think I'm kinda fearless
But even with no attention, you can kinda tell this motherfucker killing this section
You can kinda tell this motherfucker still an erection
But getting harder by the minute, just admit it, it's sexy
The funny fact about this shit, I gotta rap 
about the fact I wanna rap about this shit to even rap about this shit
Nobody been sleeping on Dicky
It's only been a year and bitches been sleeping on Dicky
Nobody took over the tape with they first tape
This motherfucker hasn't struggled since the first grade
Add it up, there's no excuse to berserk, Dave
Can't debate this shit, you got to skip, you not on first tape
So what the fuck am I mad for
What's some other shit that I could actually spaz for
Maybe it's the fact that I've been stuck in this lab for
A hundred fucking days straight cooking up raps or
The fact this shit been taking over every thing in life
I gotta make it so I made the call to leave it all behind
That's my girl, that's my world, that's beyond being busy
Now the only one that gets to David Burd is Lil Dicky
See, I told you this about me
Go on and look up in the mirror, see with LD
Who you hate, boy
Only care about me, said I'm straight, boy
Maybe I'm the one that gotta hit when I wanna murder shit
Y'all probably thinking Who is David Burd and shit
Y'all just wanna hear some LD
But I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing
Hey, man... man
Hey... hey
I guess y'all on board
Young Man couldn't leave that shore
Had the life they made for him 'til he seeked out more
Boat rock, couldn't see that storm
Held it up, dawg
He know he close
It's too late to jump ship Hey
Aw, damn! Aw, damn!
You that motherfucker shit
I know
This here became a trip, Cabo
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know
And you too U2 must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden, Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just prayin', I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know
I saw the world like, Hold up
Damn near fakin' on the side
Let me take you on a ride
Let me tell you bout the one who couldn't take the 9 to 5
Use to take the 95 down to Richmond
Bumpin' Jigga up in the ride
Use to think along and drive
'Bout my drive
Used to wonder why
Used to wonder when the world'l see like I'm seein' mine
Use to whine
Use to wanna shine
Used to wanna dine
Used to talk to bitches in my mind when they were walkin' by
Girl, what's happenin' Girl what's happenin'
I ain't really 'bout to get involved that's what's happenin'
Errything I knew was unevolved like a Baptist
Layin' on my matress
Prayin' I could have this, and
Now when I get Tinder matches
They think they've been Catfished
Now I been controlling how we livin' like a facist
Now I got this weight up off my shoulders like a strapless
Remember this shit was hapless
Remember the day it happened
Aw, you the shit Dave, you be killin' everything you did
Got the whole world talkin' all about what you did
Got your old girl talkin' all about what you is
Got your old world lookin' like it's his you ain't here
I been fuckin' for the fuck of it
And one of the bitches I been fuckin' with
Been wondering how I can work this much and stomach it
She wonders what I want from it
I said, We don't gotta get into it
She like Nah, just do it
She a psychology student
She always followin' up
Find the guy to be amusing as fuck
Usually I'll answer her truthfully
But truthfully, I'm unusually used to being unusually good at internalizing when music is not provided
But I humor hoe
Ask her if she ever saw the Truman Show
She like yeah
I like well, when I saw that shit I was convinced I was livin' like Jim
A similar situation where I was the basis of everyone's entertainment
Like really up in the basement talkin to y'all
In the mirror because I thought Lil David was some American hero
I know it's selfish and all
But I just felt it's my call
I was a ten year old then
By 2010 I was wrong
I'm like
Aw, damn! Aw, damn!
You the motherfucker though
I know
That shit became a trip, Cabo
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know
And you too U2 must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden, Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just playin', I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know
Twenty three bars up in my apartment
I am debarred
Gotta do this shit
I gotta recharge
But I gotta be smart
Movin' up that ladder company
Star, fuck it, that ain't nothin'
I am *the* star
Spittin' like a retard
Work was like a prison
I'm just seein' bars
My boss was all up in my camp
And I'm just seein' Lars
I been a heavyweight, Muhammad Ali
And if he can mold that out of Clay
Then I can turn the Lil D
So now I'm snappin' like I'm Truman
But off and on
There's always somethin' in the way
I should be often gone
Girl I'm sorry if this draggin'
I just need you to imagine
Bein' stuck up on the land without a captain
When everyday is average
And everyday you feelin' like a captive
And feel like somethin' seriously lackin'
And then you fear what could happen if you just leave it on the table like napkins
But, yo, you really fearin' hitting them rappin's and leaving everything behind
Cause you don't know what that horizon brings
But girl you gotta know what kind of fish you is
Survival instinct kicked in
Sink or swim
I flipped a playlist
Quit my day gig
Now, I'm on a boat, Lonely Island
Irony, and you still been tryin' to figure how I work this tirelessly
But girl
This is everything I've thought
This for everything I've fought
This for who I am to me becomes to y'all
Go
They tellin' me nah
But I just be tellin' them yeah Go
I just be tellin' them yeah Go
I just be tellin' them yeah
Tell 'em I'm gone Yeah
I just pretend I ain't scared Go
Don't even know I was there Go
Don't even know if I care
Cause girl this is Truman approachin' the wall
Until I'm me I am nothin' at all
Until I'm free I will not see beyone
I had to be who I was all along
Ay [crash]
I think I mighta broke it down
Hoppin' on the fuckin' steps like ain't no around
Open up that door, you bet, ship ain't goin' down
Guess the only thing left is to take a bow
Aw, damn! Aw, damn!
You that motherfucker shit
I know
This ship became a trip, Cabo
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know
And you too U2 must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden, Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just prayin', I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know
Just I know Fuck! Just I know echo
That felt good
Well, that's all I got
The show is over, as they say
Honestly, I just think that part in the Truman Show where his boat hits the wall is really the exact
Moment that I'm at in my own life right now
Uh... metaphorically, of course
And I'm ready for - I think I'm read for it
Like I've been thinkin' about it, I think I'm ready
I mean, if I'm being completely transparent with y'all
Uh, like my lifestyle hasn't really changed that much
Uh, you know, considering, uh, where I think I'm at musically
Like I'm still at the point right now where pretty much any bitch that tweets at me anything remotely flirtatious
I have seen not just one of your pictures, I have seen the entire catalog
That's the type of shit that's goin' down over here right now, so...
I am definitely ready for that, uh, next step, y'know what I'm sayin'
I think it's close, too
I think it's close
Like, uh, Diddy tweeted about me
Uh, y'know, that... I don't know if he handles his own Twitter
I would assume he probably doesn't, actually
But, like, I'm so confident that I feel as though, like, me and Diddy will have a moment just about this outro
Like when we're both sittin' next to each other smokin' cigars
And bein' like, Ay, remember when you said that shit on that outro
Like, and I'm like, Yeah. That's, this is the exact moment I - I did that for, y'know what I'm sayin'
Bring the - bring the beat back up. I don't know why
Like, keep, loop everything. I wanna be talkin' for minutes, yeah, uh, y'know what I'm sayin'
Like, uh, shout out my Macbook Pro
Had that shit since '09
I made my first song ever on it
Like, when I called myself Lil Dicky
I made my, like, fuckin' album song on that shit
And we survived, baby
Uh, shoutout Allen Iverson, Larry David, Will Smith, and Kobe Bryant
For makin' me the man that I am today
Both on and off the court
Shout out my mother
What a great woman
She's so mad I recorded these conversations
She - she honestly went crazy
It took so much convincing to allow this
But, she's awesome
She's adapting to the rap game, as we all are
Look, I just want to get this to a place where I can sell TMZ pictures of my actual asshole
Heh, y'know
Cause, well, I, I think that'd be such a feat
If I could actually create, like, an alt alias
And sell TMZ pictures of my own asshole
Like, profit off of that
That, I would totally do it
I don't know why Seth Rogen's not already doing it
I don't, I'm seein' the signs that it's not, I'm
I think I'm seein' the signs
I hope I am
If I'm really just misreading all these signs
Then, I am 100% gonna have, like, a legitimate nervous breakdown
Uh, at some point very soon
So, we'll find out about that
But I see some signs
Like, like I really am not fuckin' that much
But, like, the other day I did fuck a bitch to music
Like, I fucked a bitch to some Miguel
And that's kind of new for me if I'm bein' real
Like, I had never actually done it before
But I was feelin' like I was some king shit
Y'know what I'm sayin'
So, I was like, Man, Imma fuck this bitch to some Miguel right now
Uh, actually to be completely real to you, I, I will never fuck a girl to music again
I found the whole thing to feel, like, completely cliche
Like, I don't need my emotions dictated to me by, like, music
It makes me feel like I'm in a TV scene
Takes all the, like, realness out of the moment for me
Like, actually, was actually super weirded out by it
So, but still, like, I am about to let my hair down
And, I don't know, I just feel like it's all comin'
I feel like, like, I'm literally, like, about to find out about everything
And it's exciting
And, I, y'know, I, I had pinkeye last week
And I remember thinkin' that, as I, like, was like, real down
Cause I was, like, trying to keep recording and shit
But I was thinking, What would Michael Jordan do
And he would play through the pinkeye
So that's why I'm in here
I'm still not fully recovered, y'know what I'm sayin'
I, I'm definitely clearin' up
Like, it's totally on the upswing
But, I just want you know I did record this shit through pinkeye
Alright, I could talk for fuckin' years
Legitimate years
This is an outro to an out
You see how long I talk with outros to songs
But, goddamn
Look, I need to get out of here
I'm 'bout to go take a Khalifa
Rest up
That's right, I did invent that phrase just there
Take a Khalifa
Y'know what I'm sayin'
I also invented That's what she said
But I get no credit for it
Uh, oh, shoutout to Dickheads, obviously
Fundin' this whole operation
Whatchu know about a Kickstarter, man
Whatchu know about the best fans in the world
Seriously
Thank you guys, I appreciate it
Honestly, you made my dreams come true, and that's fact
Couldn't have done this without y'all
Uh, I'd like to shoutout my dick
I know, y'know, we haven't had the smoothest relationship
But, I feel as though by kind of putting our issues out there
Like, we have become something bigger than we could have become otherwise
And, hopefully soon you will be rewarded for your patience
And I will be rewarded for my patience
I, and, I respect you
I'd like to shoutout my brain
My brain got the hardest verse on the whole goddamn album
I hope my brain starts gettin' some feature looks
But he don't just hop on shit
Fuck, I, I got nothin' left

New shit looking like it's knocking
Rap game, not a game, well I ain't broke so it's cast off
Really I been keepin' shit a hunnid like the Cubbie tryin' to close it with a fast ball
I don't even do this shit for money but they buying it in droves like it's half-off
If Dicky gotta show out there
You know he 'bout to show out there
Rol on my arm
Russ on a farm
Piston, new guard
They put the boy on the Jumbotron
Just to pump up the crowd
At my ten year reunion, like look at me now
Having good sex on the reg
New Tempur-Pedic, my bed
All of my lawyers are black
Shit is ironic as hell
But I guess that what happens when Jews started rappin'
Used to have turtles, no wonder I'm snappin'
Used to commercial, right, used to play Madden
No wonder they let me do both for a bag
I was not in a frat, I had never conformed
In a 2000 cab I had never performed
I ain't takin' no L's
Fuck what you sell
I barely pay for my drinks, doin' well
I tell 'em there is no need for the glitz
I don't need sparklers, they know that I'm lit
I'm on top of the world, fuck all these girls
I prefer momma to play with my curls
I can tell all of you rappers ain't thorough
Head hit the pillow and boom it's tomorrow
But how can you sleep ew, ew
How can you sleep ew
How can you sleep gross, how
How can you sleep how ew
How can you sleep how gross
How can you sleep how ew
How can you sleep how ew
You still asleep
How many bitch ass rappers I gotta slap 'till they put on Worldstar
Even though Q passed away
Pull a '38 out of my pocket and then cock it
Leave a nigga on an island like he in Castaway
Cock strong since them old Doc songs thug life
Like an old Pac song, outta my mind
The lights on, but I'm not home
Something is wrong with me
I done brought six strippers from Vegas home with me
Trees bought game to getting blown with me
FaceTime with Karrueche, they on the phone with me
Tell K good night, I'm hype, I might ignite
Plastic cups, Promethazine and Sprite
Man I don't really know who's song this is
Who's weed I'm stealing and who's bong this is
And I don't really give a fuck 'cause I keep the ammo tucked and you can keep on swinging from my nuts
But don't say I can't rap like I'm not a Rap God
Like I won't break your fucking favorite rapper's rap jaw
I don't give a shit
Big or tall, short or small
I'll cut your dick off and sit it on Trump's wall
Then spraypaint Fuck the President it's evident
Hip Hop dead, them new niggas irrelevant
Different color braids, you niggas stuck in the maze
Ain't grew up by a beach, to say you ridin' a wave
Man, I'm so glad that Guwop out
And rap fans still give a fuck what 2Pac 'bout
I'm right here, I don't give a fuck who hop out
Don't let Mark Zuckerberg get you knocked out
And don't try me over IG
Don't try to be subliminal and get it by me
I'm a criminal, I'll leave you hooked to a IV
Next to Jimmy Iovine over hood shit, but-
We could start with rap shit
I ain't never lost at that shit
Let me clear it up, Proactive

You'll get embarrased

Flow the rarest
Got bitches in the bed room, over sharing
Got an Aussie and a Brit like I’m going with Sharon

I'm really adamant, you're really adequate
I'm really passionate, I'm Billy Madison
I'm the motherfucking graduate
Twenty ten with a pen, I didn't plan this shit
My plan legit, I manuscript it
It was living by the candle stick
But for the plaques I had to mantle it
All my friends thought Dicky was a joke
Now they tryin' to see a show
Now they out of breath, tryna speak good
I remember everyone that didn't think I could
Every publicist who thought that I was mocking hood
Look what what you were tryin' to stopping jerk
Look who tryin' to rap now

If what's done is done, how come I ain't done with you
And if it's fucking done, come on how dumb is you
Let me get another tissue
I'll be crying 'till the fucking bank pull that card again
From Charlamagne to Busta, Game, to Puff, to Sway, Questlove, T-Pain, from Snoop to Chainz, it's all the same
Ain't no debate, they know who fake, they know who great
You don't know your place
Cameras around me, they don't know your place
Shooters around me 'cause I entertain
I got 'em shooting they movie
I could meet a bitch on a Tuesday
Girls come to me
Don't got jewelry
Don't feel bad when I bust in my jacuzzi

Someone dat spit it redundant to someone incumbent
Then he dumber than bricks ya dig
Listen to these bitches making hits and
You'll see the horrendousness dat be existing
Every minute some kid is diminishing a single
Written like a semi-retarded kid in kindergarten
Except he harder than me, so poor Lil Dicky is stuck
Watching stupid muthafuckers
Make music and caking foolish
While jewish muthafuckas rate movies
Okay cupid to do a lil fuckin
But if it's bout the rap, they on't want it
That's why I tell em look
Looking at a bitch, it's a beautiful view
Snookie kinda tits, with a booty for two
But she really fit, word to Scooby and Doo
So I pursue it like I do in the booth
That mean I really wanna hit, holla at her like ayo what it do
I ain't your daddy, I ain't mad at you moves
The way you dancing got me staring cause you badder
Than a bear at the zoo
Who doesn't care particularly for the food
And get embarrassed when there is a lot of people staring into his lair
And he very hairy and the air isn't good
She said okay I'm understanding the comparison
So chill with the narrative, cause you scaring me away from you dude
Then I said, I said okay, that was my bad

Wanted to impress you, why the fuck you think I buy plaid

Decide fast, cause I'm bout to get up in the the ride and take a ride fast
She replied yes, now we driving
And now she kissing on ya dude
But the minute she unzippin's when I think I gotta poop'
But the minute she unzippin's when I think I gotta poop'
Now your man is rolling all around the motherfucking city
While he holding on a bitty
While he holding in a shit
He can't control it, so he focused, but she groping on his dick
He wanna bone her, but he told her that he feeling sorta iffy
But she really wanna get it bro
Feeling on a testicle
But Lil Dicky reeling what he feeling is intestinal
Goddamn it what the fuck should I do
Cause shawty really wanna get in the mood
But Dicky been had to poop
And now she kinda confused
Been persistent but the kid been tryna resist her moves,
Doing 60 in a 20, I got reason to move
Cause I been squeezing on my buttcheeks like a prisoner do
And now I'm getting close to panicking
Stomach is unraveling
Every fucking bump has got me clutching on my abdomen
I swear this isn't happening
I'm staring at the back of the Cadillac in the passing lane
Swearing up at the traffic mayne...
Man this is harder than all madden
I'm airing out the car because I'm farting like a savage
She started fucking grabbing, on ma part to make some magic
But I'm hardly harder than some corduroys up on a rabbit
So I tell her that the plans change
Don't mean to act strange
But I gotta go, I left ma phone up in the last place
She gave me the sad face
Started typing numbers at a fast pace
Glowing black case on the dash, great
So I told her thanks babe,
But I forgot I gotta water fucking plants up at my aunts house that way
But shawty still up on your man
She caressing and undressing me and then I shit ma pants
Now ya man is rolling all around the motherfucking city
Trying hold in that he shitted, cause he rolling with a bitty
Now ya man is rolling all around the motherfucking city
Trying hold in that he shitted, cause he rolling with a bitty
But he tripping, and he twitching cause he hoping she don't sniff it
But he only got a minute till she notice that he did it
So he pull over the car and
Do it like he Tarzan
Rip all of his clothing then go into the forest
Minute later shawty came in the nude
And then I laid her on a sycamore root
Nobody knew that I pooped
Nobody know that I pooped
Fucking right, nobody knew that I pooped
Until I got back in the wip up with that chick
And she could sniff all the poop and
So then I told her that it must have been goose,
She said I think you mean geese
I said that's what I mean
Seen a dozen of them motherfuckers in the ravine
Then she said what's a ravine
I said the thing in between us and all the greenery
I mean it's a stream, don't know why I said ravine
Then she said oh I see, and then
It's like, these days dicky been up on his grind

Not Gilbert, but I'm sellin out arenas
Do it all day A peterson
Because I'm tryna get paid like Revis did
I met a French bitch, big lips, and she got a body
Told her put that ass on moi like nnamdi
Fight like rocky, white like Roddy
Hoosier Daddy all knight like Booby
Hot box ride, I can barely see
You know I keep ma car melo like Anthony
Got bigger blunts than legarrete, smoke outta Taurus
Put Mar kief in dat philly like Morris
Anybody better better than me, good try
I'm the best like Jahvid, but I'm not lion
Not even a tyson... no ear biting
Ma pockets fat with green, so Rex Ryan
I ball for the bucks like Luc Richard Mbah a Moute,
But I'm a fuckin superstar
And if they ask LD where he wanna live
Then I'm a tell 'em where markakis like Nick.
I'm tryna get a little Kevin Love
And then I see a bad bitch starin up in the club
She got an ass so sweet like a cinnabun
I bet dat bitch a giant freak like Lincecum
And so I go and approach her
We kick it like Stover
End of the night, I'm a ownher, hova
Liquor make a bitch feel raunchy, horny
So I'm getting big shots, Chauncey, horry
Took her back at ma Eddie House
And this fine ass bitch takin off her blouse
And then ma D Rose quicka than a bull at the garden
Dick like James from the way that it Harden
My name ain't Charles, but I pack wood son
Ma dick ain't Gretzky, but it's still a good one.
She want that juice I ain't talkin bout OJ
It's more like Mayo, something like OJ
Okay, now her clothes are off
And I can see her C pierced like her name was Paul
I couldn't care less, went down feelin the flavor
It was hairless, something like Villanueva
Ma Rod Smart, so He Hate Me
When I don't cover him up with a safety
But I coordinate that D, so I planned protection
Had a Magnum Rolle like louisania tech did
Put a condom on ma Ryan Braun
Ma Hebrew hammer, then we got it on
I was playin with a boobie, Cavalier
We even made a couple movies, Shaq O'Neil
She had a real big cat, Andres Gallaraga pussy
But I hit it hard, Troy Polamalu on that pussy
No acting but she had a big O Oscar
No PED's little Dicky ballin proper let's go.
Friday fucking night
We bout to do this right
Dicky rollin to the club, he about to find his wife
Cause he fresher than a kid that called his mom a fuckin ho
Bunch a bitches getting low
Pimpin you already know
I'm bout to get up on the flo and then bring chicken to ma crib
Getting drunk up in this muthafucka, fuck you think this is
Then I see a bad bitch with a booty and a half
I make a move on that cutie, excuse me do you wanna dance
Then she looked at me and laughed
Like I didn't have a chance
Like I shouldn't even asked
So I proceeded to get trashed
And I'm at the bar now, and it's so loud
But I'm takin shots, and I'm throwin down
And I see a pretty lady, so I send her some of that cold brown
And she turned around, and then turned it down
Because in her words, she don't like to flirt with clowns
And I'm alone and pouting, overcrowded, I need to get up out this club
I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones
None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but gone
Bout to quit, but I'm bitter I paid that cover
So I guess I gotta stay in this stupid club a bit longer
And I'm sweating like a jew in a multicultural sauna
They been playing fuckin dubstep for ten consecutive songs
And then I bumped into a guy
He was roughly 6 foot 5
Pretty sure it was his fault, but I apologized
Pretty sure you know the type, probly bankin every night
Vodka sprite, lookin round to find a kike that he can fight
Or suckerpunch, I'm kinda drunk, and I been in the club for way too long
Now I'm up in the corner, all alone, ESPN up on ma phone
Ma self esteem is so depleted, such a mess, I'm overheated
I regretfully just tweeted some depressing shit, I need to leave this club
I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones
None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but gone
Is this really for the bathroom, are you kidding
This the type of line where people squeeze they dick to prevent pissing
When I get inside the stall it's like a yeti had been shitting
And there's piss all on the ground, so as I'm wizzing I keep slipping
Fuck this hand stamp
Club is really damn cramped
Fuck it, I'm a suck it up and take another damn chance
Ughh, here goes nothing c'mon D
Ay girlie, what's the word
At first glance I may look like a nerd
But if you let me, bet D, get thee, all up in the bed so wet like a mafuckan jetski
Real rap if you tryna go, then put your name right here up inside ma phone
She took bait, no way, typing out her home, she pressed save,
Walked away, and her name was no
I been inside this club for way too long
I wanna leave and eat calzones
None of these females wanna bone
Ma self esteem is all but gone
Iont fuck around
I been getting down
Not afraid to eat some triscuits up off the ground
5 second rule
I'm on that 5 year
A lotta guys fear what I got in my ears wax
If I ain't pissin then you know I'm shittin bricks
Do it sick, when I finish homie I ain't washin shit
Shaved dick, shave with, same shit, face get
Bitches sittin on ma pillows and they butt naked
Lickin grease off of that pizza
And these mafuckas prolly want a paper towel
Errybody know that I rape toenails
When I pick, then I flick em on the straight up ground now
Ain't shit to a mafuckan balla
Mo grit than a mafuckan dolla
Come back from ballin, you gotta smell sack
Yea it's that appalling
And Ion't ever wash ma feet
When I'm in the shower, they be hard to reach
When I'm getting down, goin out on the weekend
I'm asleep before I brush my teeth
I'm a goddamn G tho
Mo grime than Ed Reed's pee hole
Mo grime than Ronaldhino
These other rappers can't deny it
Cause I don't even act like a thug
But I'm cold enough
I ain't moving crack, holdin guns
But there's more than one dimension to a balla
You can find ya boy around the way
Being scummy and fucking grubby you know I'm tryna say
That I'm grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch swag
Grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch swag
It take a slimy muthafucka to be grimy as a grundle
So you in trouble, if you attempt to try to be as gutter as the kid
Eating wings
Beating off
Dick stings from the muthufuckan hot sauce swagga
Came nuts... no tp
Lazy so I rub it on the damn sheets
Ya man D on that reggie evans shit
Boogie pickin, boogie flickin, hella belly button lint
Fuck a bitch, and I'm wetter than a muthafuckin swish
Yeah I'm sweating more than CC bases loaded, bottom 6
I'm eating mixed nuts with my mouth wide open
At bar a bar where them house flies float
Iont give a fuck if it flush if I must urinate
Not a place up in the house I wouldn't go
I sink piss, and I sniff clothes
Nastier than Kimbo
And I lick snow
When it's yellow
And I sleep at the hotel on
That old blanket that yo mamma used to never let you touch
I just don't give a fuck, I'm nasty like the nut of johnny kruk
I do the dutch oven to maself
Fuckin with the way it smells
So if someone sicker well then tell me
Cause I don't even act like a thug
But I'm cold enough
I ain't moving crack, holdin guns
But there's more than one dimension to a balla
You can find ya boy around the way
Being scummy and fucking grubby you know I'm tryna say
That I'm grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch swag
Grimy as a gooch
Grimy grimy as a gooch swag
It take a slimy muthafucka to be grimy as a grundle
So you in trouble, if you attempt to try to be as gutter as the kid
What it do
Was 22 up in the room
Thinkin bout a way that I could make a move
Make a boom
Debated to move to LA
To make it in movies
But traded the pool shade and gravitated to music
Now I'm spittin the hottest shit
It don't matter the competition
Is sadder than a bladder that be lackin a pot to piss in
It's actually kinda sicknin
The rap is beyond horrific
Admit it bruh, waka flaka flame is somehow respected
The game has gotta change, used to listen to jay
Up on the train, now they floodin the waves with 2 chainz
I feel like I separate with ma lines like 2 lanes
It's a dark knight when the joker's better than them banes
Of the rap game, all of 'em rap lame,
They claimin all em ballin, well then all of em sac kings
At least they in the league tho
I can't even cop a fuckin peacoat
That's why I'm aiming outside the box, like it's a free throw
The weed smoke fuckin the air up
Got this mothafucka snackin more than Miggy Cabrera
Got dis mafucka rappin some crack and yappin about it on his cell phone
Tell holmes this is the track, that I got ma swell on
And I spit that shit so fast sometimes I need to slow it down
All these bitches up in the crib, it's like ma home a pound
Tell me I ain't hold it down
Spittin ridiculous, ticklin bitches
Up into they britches, and rip em like tickets
And fastballs, lookin at a cutie on the dance flo
I visualize that booty with the pants off
Had a little dance off
And I ain't had no shot it was the ass fault
Cause shawty body arguably hotter than august asphault
They claimin they great, man these rappers straight lebroning
I'm layin in wait, to smack the fuck up out dat spalding
I'm hatin every song, they celebratin poppin dom
But I be takin shots a brandy like a kobe at the prom pic
Bomb shit, ya'll should see ma muthafuckin blonde bitch
The bombs on dat body shawty just gotta be Islamic
I twist and I turn her on till she wet like she a faucet
No rapper give you more a set... isn't it ironic
Because I'm seein these labels
Pumpin out the horseshit, got me callin em stables
Pumpin out the tours quick, but they ain't makin hits
Ain't nobody great as this
White boy killin brothers on that cane and abel tipppp
Tri tip steak, up on a plate, I'm on a date
With a dime bitch, nibbling cake
But nevermind that
Someone tell me where the fuck the rhymes at
I was bumpin nas in his prime and you gonn sign that
Oh well, guess I'm better than they'll ever be
I could do it serious but they prefer the levity
I ain't really hearin nuffin
Say I ain't the man
I'm layin in sand, zero spf for the tan
But now I'm back in this muthafucka, spit hotta than a flame throw
Waitin to hear em call on ma name like rap a game show
Tell me this is lame,
Though I know that is bogus
Gotta focus
Be the dopest
With the most set of quotes, and the grossest
When I flow sick, and the hope is
Notice is right around the corner, my time to shine
Is almost aligned, something like a quarter to nine
If I could have a quarter for the metaphors in my rhymes
I'd only have a couple dollas so I'm stickin with dimes, ya know
They getting off like a train stop
I'm lookin at ma dick like how the fuck do you stay rock
No southern carolina, how you got so much game cock
Cause you movin that vagina in the dark like a stage prop
It's all good
I'm making this the outro
I had to fuckin spit, this is what I'm about bro
And you know what it is, holla back up at the kid Slim Boner
So damn hard, this shit is over
Now look at all these muthafuckas out on Pride Rock
Lotta livestock
Think it's cause Sarabi ride cock, or she did once
Cause they celebrating Simba
Lil cub, errbody gotta kneel cause
Deal was, lions was some muthafuckin real thugs
And the fear of, being turned into a meal was
Such a fright yo, but on the real they hella nice tho
This specific pack of lions acting like some white folks
But Africa is full a brothas, one is Uncle Scar
And that muthafucka wasn't nuffin funny son he hard
And he mad too
Cause he just wanna be the man too
First it was his brother, now another king is brand new
Baboon drawin on a tree ya dig
There's something freaky bout rafiki, bet his weed legit
That muthafuckin monkey doesn't need comedians
The reason is, he laughin at the breeze and shit, it's weird
Alrite now back to the plot
Mufasa was a wonderful father, he loved him a lot
And Simba wanted to impress him every second he got
The youngn was taught... but then one afternoon he forgot
Thas when he holla'd at nala, to follow da balla
To crawl up in da squalor
Where all uh da lawless acknowledge his father
But they never gave a fuck bout a little bitty pup
Aw shucks... they gonn eat this mafucka up
Until his dad came through, and smacked dem bitches in the head
Coulda had em dead, but he let em runaway instead
Now he really mad at dude
He cute when he sad tho
And the simple truth, Simba doin what his dad do
Shit... now das some real talk homie.
But he can't own them fields with dem lil paws homie
And real dogs only bark at bitches when they gotta do
Taught him to, think when he at the line like an audible
And now the part I abhor
Lil Simba chillin with a chameleon, perfecting his roar
Could a been a gecko but dat shit echoed, effectin the gorge
Was accidental, but you know what's in store, the stampede scene
Shit... and he was all up on a stick, gotta hold a grip
Simba you done got up in some shit
But his dad came through, and he saved him man
But as he climbed with them wounds, Mu raised his hand
But dude his brother on some muthafuckin scar face
Scar face, lit up like a muthafuckin star'n space
Hard place, and a rock, mufasa caught up in between that
Das his brother but that brotha was a mean cat
And when he threw him off the ledge
Simba couldn't believe dat that muthafucka dead
Tears being shed
Scar got up in his head
More dread for da boy, so he ran away and fled
Timon and pumba time
The young cub grown up, what a beautiful lion
They grub bugs, cub's nuts hittin puberty while
The voice of change up - ferris buller style, ya know
And they was tryna eat a beatle
A lion came through, tryna dine, hella regal
Then pumba got stuck, bout to get his ass cut
But then Simba stepped up, and defended like a thug do
Rollin round he realized who it was too
Hollad back at nala like whassup boo
Hugged smooth
Confused
Nala lookin pretty, titties done grew
Butt cute
He bout to fuck soooooon
Then he nuzzled from the back
And he cuddled from the front
He was really mackin jawn
She all up on his junk
You could see me jackin off to scene, believe dat
The young me, fuckin around with cats, I need that
To recap, lotta feedback, Simba react
The fam need dat... but ya man can't be back
He just wanna do his thing ya dig
But he the king
Even tho he wadnt feelin it
Until he met up with the monkey
What a funky fuckin junkie
But he spunky, told the muthafuckin lion bout his country
And he ran back
Pride rock got it's man back
But damn... the whole land hella ransacked
And then he saw scar with his mom
Sarabi lookin hella worn, hidden Simba looked on
As scar did her like a dog, hit her hard with his palm
Forreal dog
Alrite you fuckin with the God now
Long growl
Pimpin' handle bidness like a boss now
Tossed down
Talkin shit to Simba bout to cost clown
Scar tell the young'n that he killed his pops tho
Foreal mafucka He revealed his hops bro
And clocked on that muthafuckin sucka with a cross
Rocked uncle with couple then sunk him with a toss
He on't play that shit... brothas and lacrosse
Real talk... the dogs done finished him off
And pride rock was back where it started at
The meals back, fields packed with the hardest cats
Foreal jack... the animals is feelin dat
The real is back... and I just spit the realest rap, ya know
And Simba musta hit it hella freaky
Gotta keep it PG
But you see Rafiki with da pee =wee baby
Dat right there mean he merckin' it right
The dude piped... but that's just the circle of... life.
Sup y'all
It's your boy, L-D
A.K.A. Slim Boner
This does not have shit to do with Sports Center,
But I want to dedicate this to all the Sports Center anchors out there making our nights easier
Ay, what's really really good with it

I cheef a mound piff, and now I'm really freakin out this bitch bro.
I'm the biggest pussy rappin all day
I'm a represent it lovin me some rent on broadway
Call it gay, but fuck it, it's really lovely
To come up in really comfy pajamas
With a mama and knowledge of commas and college
But all these other rappers think thuggin is cool
These mafuckas so redundant with the drugs in the jewels
But I ain't buggin... ma stomach getting sun by the pool
I'm with a mexicano jawn straight getting azul
Foreal tho
Real flowin, jabronis is still frontin with it
Real open spittin, ma dick is a mere couple inches
Meals made of truffle,
Ma kitchen is real troublesome
I'm real good at hugging, and snugglin,
Somewhat at fuckin and
I heard this shit on workaholics
And this for errbody bout to finish college
It's only right that I drop a little knowledge
Cause life ain't like it outta be
I thought it'd be, a lotta women callin me
And sodomy, and drinkin like it's all for free
Illogically, I never thoughta poverty
Or how this muthafucka's muthafuckin job would be
But ever since I go the cap and gown
Errybody cracking down, nappin now
Erry fuckin snack got me packin pounds
Wearin fuckin slacks, got me scratching da back uh ma sack
And rap is not exactly a faculty rapidly rackin me
Anything but apathy for those who be naggin and draggin me
Into the wackest meetings, holding me back from eating
The saddest fucking lunch I pack and bag in the evening
Ma bank is depleted, I even have to think before tweeting
Man it's really fuckin sad when thinking bout
The evolution from the past to drinking now
We used to go and split a handle, drink it down
Then hit the town, and hit the hottest chicks around
But now I can barely slug a half a dozen tops
Used to chug a lot, now I'm fuckin buzzin off a shot whoa
Clubbin wasn't nuffin to me boy
Used to walk up in that muthafucka stuntin like whassup, I wadn't coy
Ain't nobody gave a fuck if I'm employed
Errybody drunk and fuckin lovin it, rubbin, and huggin
Mugging, chugging and fuckin but now these bitches
Is up on some other shit, wanting a husband
Clubbin got me buggin and blushing cause I'm a young'n das confronted
With a hundred abundantly rugged, and coveted, funded muthafuckas, it's humbling
Think about the age range
They get to date way older and emotionally open homies goin gray
Now I'm up on first dates
Sober like it's first grade
Hoping when it's over that I close it with some first base shit
Ma face getting fuckin fat
It's April, hateful fillin fuckin taxes out
Long ass days, getting blazed, and tappin out
Back is naggin now, mac is laggin now
Because I bought it back in college
So if you comin lemme run a little knowledge
If you was wondering if fun isn't acknowledged
Well Wednesdays, I be watching workaholics
Wasup ya'll let me preface this by saying this is not a Mac Miller diss by any means
I actually like mac miller butt, but right now he probably is the most popular rapper excluding Eminem
And I'm just not even close so you can understand why I would rap over one of his beats
I got a little bit of Kobe in me and if Kobe saw Lebron he would wanna rap over one of his beats
Metaphorically speaking, I know he ain't Lebron, butt, but you get what the fuck I'm saying
Maybe he's more of a Jo Johnson type of shit, no disrespect
Fuck... this undergrad bitch tryn fuck
And her chest deserves an A, like she handle da puck
She know D been bumpin Drake like ya man a Canuk
Homie even if it's May in LA... I'm so fuckin cold
Roll good on that Westside
Hoes cook like they country thick
So hood up in Best Buy
Controller, D punkin kids
Loading up the used dishes
Rollin up with two bitches
Hope they old enough
To get folded up, I'm not bold enough to do prison
I been drinkin sippin something so horrific, ya dig it
Because I tipped the bartender extra, then he put extra liquor
In dat shit. Goddamn. Das a misinterpretation
Hate it when they stiff. Overtipping cause I'm caking
Take in errything a mafucka say
Been about rap, figured out that from the basement
I ain't talkin bout rap city on black entertainment
Talkin bout the place I was raised in
Plate full uh bacon
Making a bagel and bake on occasion
Back then woulda made rap for grades
Now a mafucka make rap for pay
And them bitches too
Chickens that I'm bangin so appealing
They been Shagging on ma balls, like they practicing they fielding and
I Sorta make em pop off
Make em take they socks off
Round the fuckin bases then get pounded like a walk off
Aw naw...
This a fucking statement I'm making
They been hesitating to give lil David space at the table
Cause they label a capable able jew gay and too playful
Watching cable naked, the AC blowin major like slater's dad
Why you hater's mad
Maybe I should get a couple tats
Maybe I should get in trouble and be dumbin down the rap
Look at Mac
White as fuck but lookin thugger than a trap spot
Need another mac 'stead of luggin round this laptop
Blackballed
From the muthafuckin rap blogs

Ion't think it mean I gotta act hard
Fuck it tho

From the back so fable of me woof
Cream cheesin, philly bred - so bagel of me
When dicky dead, this is never gonna be... so

Boneless chicken patties
Been clubbin like this muthafucka's rollin with a caddy
And now that I been rappin, all these bitches holla me
Had to put a daily cap on the head, no Aladdin
Know I'm average looking, and I'm bragging bout getting chickens
But this spitting got me positioned to be banging out bitches
Outta ma league... Jeff Teague bangin on Griffey
Would never happen less you happen to be hanging with dicky
Oh yeah I'm white, killin brothas like I'm up in the klan

Where them bitches sitting 7th inning finna fuck at
Used to fuck with bitches that was timid with the nutsack
Now I'm fuckin' bitches let me jizz up on they buttcrack
Das a fun fact, I'm
Head of ma class and ready for mine
And like a great red in a glass, I'm better with time
I mean I came letterman jacket, ready to shine
They up designer shit
I'm in footie pajamas bitch
Omelettes, bomb as shit
The rhyming sick
Competish can't conquer dis'
I'm legit, honest chicks is on ma dick
I ain't a God but... you can call me Deezus
Switch to beat up
Ye, I see ya
Bout to make more tortillas
Pork carnitas
Going straight North Korea
Poor Aaliyah
Sorta Lena
Y'all dudes more Madea
Touring, writing, rapping, snoring while I'm napping
Luring these foreign tourists to ma sack and scoring
During performances in the back and
I'm making all of this up because I'm rappin'
Inside a lucky 4 bedroom apartment
That we found on Craigslist and settled in August
You know it was rent control and it was awesome
It came with' a washer
And a dryer
Goodbye y'all
Iight, I'm blowing on that sticky shit
Everybody's talking, bitches stalking, quick as Lawson
When I'm walking to the gym and shit
Everybody wanna get involved with the Dicky kid
I don't even know the deal y'all, I'm just killing shit
I ball like I'm playin the wii
Hit up all da ATMS, I been paying the fees
Being gay about the stems, Dicky weighing the weed
And now these labels on a cleanse, got em saying
We need jews, oh the dude the scoop boos,
Boozing stupid and he rap bruising tunes amusing students
I'm the truth dude
Put some funny shit up on youtube
Now these mafuckas spitting looking shitty as doo doo
Who knew, ya dude got a lot to do
I don't fill them bitches up, but the lobster do
Plus she licking on my nut like it's pasta too
And now that Dicky blowing up all these bitches so compliant
These days dicky gotta cover up his privates
Bathroom pissing brothas buzzing on some spy shit
Man, I wish that my dick was a little bigger
Because I'm in a pickle for riddles about ma pickle
Being minimal, criminally abysmal and literally
Women I'm hitting is cognizant of every centimetre
And I'm meeting bitches who seem to be fucking Derek jeter's
Every weekend, very freaky, don't know what I'm doing to em
These bitches do the type of shit chicks in porn doing
Bathroom beating on my dick, right before I do 'em
Man that's my only chance, ya know
I'm handsome though
I gotcha lady dancing bro
Man ever since I came up in this motherfucker shit been changed
Every rapper getting madder 'bout the funny shit I'm saying
They be trapping, I be napping, steady crapping on the game
And like a rabbit out the hat I'm doing magic with the flames man
Better stop comparing me to Andy Milanokis
Andy Samberg, Adam Sandler, man I swear it's so obnoxious
I don't care about the rarity of care-free song topics
The hilarity and parody is not what's got you noddin when I write
On the mic spit, nothing like a white kid
Black bitches even fucking with me cause I'm nice with
Raps, booty big as shit, I'm in it but she quite thick
Crap, from this angle I can barely fit the pipe tip
Like da the white man bright, and me don't bite
And me won't fight, me done watch da dark knight with a cold sprite
And me so kike, kite runner up on da cold night
And me done scrub de body with ton of the old spice
But fuck it
My buddy got a crib Nantucket
And everybody here with a bitch straight fucking
And everybody here know the kid stay bumpin'
My YouTube, Smith up on the Knicks, they subbing... aww.
I just checked up in yo bitch's pussy up on 4square
Mini golfing oh so often you woulda swore I toured there
Break 'em off up in my office you know I record in there,
It's boring there so fuck it
I been caking, don't mistake me for some rapper you hating
I'm actually making the hottest fucking tracks in the nation
Like Satan somehow created some elaborate gymnasium
Packing bowls in stadiums, came from packing the bowl in basements
Name a rapper in the game, spit a flame like you boy can
Everybody know I got it made like a boyband
Everybody know I'm getting laid like a Troy fan
I stay with Trojans on ma shit, ya dig
Man I ain't even into being curt dude
But ma head blowin up like I'm the kurt dude
And my friends getting hung up like a shirt do
Now they ain't the only homies fuckin with da burd dude
This for all ma homies lookin like a nerd who
Got a tennis serve and never broke a fucking curfew
I been getting ready for confetti, from the first boo
Game 6, I ain't bout to finish like the spurs do
Now they tryna get ya guy a deal
Cause the flow cash money, got a tyga feel
All these majors coming at me like I'm tiger healed
But ion't think the labels know about ya guy foreal
We sittin down, kickin and riffin, diggin the sound
Different from the shit dat's been spittin from typical clowns
Finna give me money in the bag and
Hunnies from the mag and
All the other shit they tell the dummies that can rap
But the fact of the matter is I ain't the rapper
They used to using, confusing, abusing with da chatter
I mean the dude across the table
Reppin for the label
Probly never met a rapper with a business major
So I am able
To avoid the fatal
Fate that every rapper face in they appraisal
Now I got em thinkin even bartering too
It's probly harder when the fuckin rapper's smarter than you
I came through
Same dude
Same crew
Same jew
And I tell these muthafuckas errything that they ain't knew
Yain't knew I'm about to get a grammy and leave
Michael Jordan in ma genes since I been 23
Except, I ain't ball playin at all, sayin da bol
Gave all it the game, he played it wrong
Made the songs for the laughs cause
Funny was the path but
Now I really wanna fuck these dummies in they asses
Practiced
Tell me I ain't climbing up that rap list
I bet a lot of fans'll listened to this and feel catfished
Damn where da Dicky dat I used to know
The goofy flow
Ma dude where the humor go
Well truth be told, I'll put that in a movie, show, or musical
But now I'm in the studio
And dudes in the booth knew that the jew can flow
And if you listenin to this shit, you should know
I'm too cold in this bitch
To be actin a clown
Fuckin around
If I wanna get ma hands on the crown
I'm getting down, letting the smile, beset to a frown now
The kid up from the burbs bout to settle in downtown
But maybe that's a bad move
Maybe I'm a fucking pussy if I'm letting people tell me what I can't do
Maybe all these rappers wanna wear the same shoes
Get into the game and never playing cause they can't move
Now I'm thinkin what would Jordan do
Back when everybody only wore a boring shoe
If he settled for what every other scorer used
Then you dudes wouldn't ever get the Jordan 2s
I'm snoring through, ya muthafuckin tours and tunes
The game needs change now, it's short a few
And I don't mean to harp about the Jordan dude
But there's a little bit of him in this adoring jew
Of course you, listen to that thinkin I mean I'm great
You mistake, thinkin of rap, and I what I want a play
J wanted baseball
But he nice at playin ball
When he went away, we acting like he went all AWOL
Always got a trade off
I see Jay and Kanye the same way I see Larry David
It's cliché
And I know I'm gonn make it
But I dunno if I prefer as Dicky or as David
I guess it's sorta like the sox and bulls
But I can't leave yet, gotta lot to prove
But I'm a rock ma shoes, watch the toes
And if it hurts, then I'm a find Dr. Scholl's
And... one day, I'm a find satisfaction from rappin
Or acting, or cracking up factions of black kids
Adapting to whatever is in front of me
And like Mike, I'm a be aight because of me
One life, better think of who you wanna be
It's your eyes, doesn't matter what they wanna see
You do it right, you the only one you need to please
You ain't that alive till you doin something you believe
Dis the type of shit that's making D
Think twice bout the mafuckin comedy
Cause the mic got a mafucka on his knees
Twerk dicky, dicky dicky twerk
Twerk dicky, dicky dicky twerk
Let's go, it's your boy LD, A.K.A. watch your girl pussy, homie
Y'all missed me, don't you I stay with a boner, I'm typically hard
My dickheads, I'm sorry, for keeping you waiting
Just know that I miss you I love y'all
Been leaving you all out to dry in the dark
Like a cum loaded tissue that's reference to semen
I woke up this morning like fuck it, I got to address all the fans I do
I need y'all to know I got plans I do
I need y'all to know I been slaving away on my debut
I'm taking a page out the playbook of Jay, Big and Dre, Nas and Ye
If you studying rap like I study it then
You would know what the fuck I been tryin' to say classic
It's harder to wait it is
But it's gotta be great it do
And then when I drop that shit all y'all gonna be like Lil Dicky we made it! we made it
To everyone listening I think that it's cool that we know what they don't they don't
It's not about if, only when, and it's fun to be in on the joke
Just did my first shows, nervous as shit, never been on the road
Started in Philly I signed my first titty, I killed dat shit
Still I ain't fucking no hoes like no pussy, it's sad
A part of the reason is none of the venues equipped with a shower it's so inconvenient
So I leave for an hour and when I come back ain't no bitches around them bitches be leaving
I fuck with this sound
Rapping like Migos is fun for a clown
I could say anything and at the end of my statement
This cadence will make it profound
Like for example, ya man is about to go ham in the kitchen
I'm fixin a sandwich woo
All it is is some turkey and mayo but tell me that shit ain't dramatic! on ciabatta
It's stupid emphatic
Stomach is fucked I been poopin' erratic damn
New Santa Monica dude I just moved in in March
And I'm bout to get into some Madness
Don't confuse what my plan is
I never go out it's depressing
I meant that my bracket about get sandy
The beach on my house ehh, more like three blocks away
I'm newly an Uncle Uncle Dicky
My bro had baby he did, she cute
I'll be on by the time she can talk
Her first words'll be Dicky we made it! that's a BABY
Can't wait to be famous oh
That shit gon' be wild I bet I'll meet Drake
I'm lookin' at Jason Sudeikis like who my Olivia Wilde I need an actress
I love Anna Kendrick legitimate feelings
She never tweet back not once, ever
I figure she's busy or think that I'm creepy
But baby I'm not! unless you like that shit
I just have this vision where both of us living like Bonnie and Clyde
That's you as a singer and me as a rapper
We could be like Jay and Beyonce for whites that could be so cool
That would be the life
I'd buy the Sixers and make you my wife
Nah I'm just kiddin', I've only been smitten
With totally fictional characters right obviously we'd have to get to know each other
You could be a grouch that would suck
You could be so mean I hope not
You could be the type that need warning with oral to avoid the cream some bitches hate the taste of semen
That's graphic as fuck I suck my own dick
But some bitches is bougie I've kissed other men
Forgive me, I just wanna make this pitch perfect I love all your movies these ad-libs are fun
I need me some pussy I'd buy it
I'm scared of the AIDS the virus
I wish I was reckless
There's rappers that's been getting head up on stage Danny Brown
I'm way too afraid my dick is a pussy
My dick been enraged
But soon when I'm fuckin in public post nut, he'll look up atcha boy and say Dicky we made it! get 'em D
I'm just fuckin with the flow
You know I still be on that ya ain't really fuckin with da boy
I got 150 different ways to cut dat
Love rap
Soon they'll be fuckin with the dork like a humpback
Yeah I'm bout to bring the fun back
Every other rapper need to go get and get a dunce cap
Now I got a one track
Mind till I run rap
Mine till I'm done
Wack rhymes better run rap run ho
Mafucka shit is done wrapped over
You ain't wanna see me come back nah
Y'all hot for a summer in July in Arizona
Lil Dicky literally is where the sun at
Knowing y'all, gotta show you where the sun at hot
All of y'all been bad where my son at hot
Where my son at hot
Where my son at hot
Where my son at hot
Come get spanked, ho!
My New Year's resolution is to call these rappers hoes
And mean that
I mean that shit
Y'all some hoes y'all some hoes
Y'all some hoes y'all some hoes
Adios that's Spanish
Aye y'all, on the real
I've been like over thinking everything these days
And I just wanted to come in today
And just have no plan and just make a song
So this song ain't about shit, it's just what I'm thinking
I should have done this before
I ain't got no plans for it, but it's fun to explore
I ain't got no pants on because I'm under record
I been some non-constrictive type of shit
I left my skinny jeans up on the floor of my adorable apartament
Pardon me, part of me, hard to believe
Retarded, part of me smart as a Harvard graduate deaggregate
Well above the averages, wondering where my salad is
I hate when they get salads but
It's hard for me to challenge that
I need to fucking balance all the crap that I devour
I been scouring the internet, been tryna find an intimate
Place to take an Tinder date
Straight up I'm amazed at how infrequently they pick me
I been spitting great, you think again my ass a dinner date
I'm thinking 'bout my gas, last I looked at that graphic, shit
Was creeping to the E, that's a terrible habit, man
Honestly, your boy been way to busy making dicky shit
Gotta rap, gotta get up on the map, gotta get a nap
Gotta get it cracking and get a plaque
Gotta go attract the masses but it's such molasses going
Slow as slow can go
I don't even know if I could wait
I just wanna run but I'm growing out of shape
In my PJ's being DJ, hit a replay, tryna get a little leeway
Overthinking every little thing, it's crazy
You ain't got to be rapping so crazy, just to persuade the nation
That you know how to be rapping amazing
Bro, on occasion you should let it go and let your brain flow
And say whatever come into... oh my God, that girl's so hot
Suck my dick, ho, suck my dick
Suck my dick, ho, suck my dick
Come suck my dick, ho, suck my dick
Or at the very least, touch my dick
Okay, excuse my libido
But the titties on that girl, homie, holy toledo
I just wanna see the world, think of all of it's people
I'm living so regal but wonder what I'd see through a peephole
Into Kinsacha or some shit, impossible but
It's probable they got a lot of people feeling some stuff, so
Oddly enough, I could probly become a buff
I bet they got a show up on Discovery but fuck it
I don't really care, out of tupperware, plus I'm out of underwear
I swear that doing laundry such a process I don't wanna bare
I want a bear that I can train, just imagine pouring rain
And comin' home and there's a panda snoring on the floor
That you can hug and praise, hundred days
Since I fucked that lady, don't play me, it's crazy
But I stay in, unless they play shit, rotten tomatoes
Lable eighty seven, the higher I are I admire art
Well, certain kind of art, I hate them paintings that
I swear that your boy can make and I'm tryna get in shape
By avoiding cake and I wanna get a place where the boys can stay
With a gate when they visit Dave in LA
What a shame vaca days is dead to me
Instead dude, get bread to them
My best moves at your venues and my set playing in your bedroom
That's head to me, real shit and my hand doing real slick
Cause I swear to y'all, I ain't plan for this
It's new territory, but it's real shit
And I'm real pissed this took an hour
Instead of days, but it's amazing
What's spontaneity, do for ya
And if you don't like it, you can...
I like the way this came out, that hook is fire
You know what I'm saying
That hook is the easiest hook I ever made in my fucking life
And that shit is, that shit goes, I gotta do this shit more often
Oooo

Plus I mentally connect with the hoes I fuck
And this was a whore
I mean a literal whore
Not like massages in porn
This was an overweight asian
With no aspirations
We never developed rapport
Eatin boar’s head in my other whore’s bed
Well not a whore, but you know she ain't a girlfriend
We still about to get it crackin paul george leg
I got a napkin if I cum within the foreplay
It’s about damn time that the boy LD bout to get up in the fun shit

Now the man wit a tan got a plan and I dare a mafucka make assumptions
I dont care I ain't there, I’ll be damned if I’m bout to go and let up on the gumption
Iono the definition, fuck is average
I been sittin, watching waiting, so impatient like it’s baggage
Claim I’m bout to be the greatest, naked pictures in my chat
These other rappers fucking lazy word to bangin in a hammock
But y’all ain't even hangin

At a matinee eatin dip n dots

Algorithm isn’t doin it’s job

They probably not believing in Hobbes
The nice boy been ballin

Gotta tell my mom stop callin
But dog she confused about ma destiny
Making me repeat myself like I was judging spelling bees but
I’m just tryna smoke weed, grab a quesarito
Got azul by a Spanish chick. Muy bonito

His wife 'bout to leave his ass
He been working all night, while she give him baths
Actually, I'm pretty light, like, within his tasks
He got bigger clients, but I'm nice, so just let me bask
These white bitches let me smash

Third base for the O's, like Machado
Miss, I ordered this with Avocados, thanks
Ey, walk up in this bitch, like I was born bread
Going deeper with this spitting, like some porn head
Picture every rapper laying on the floor dead
While I'm in a chair, cross legged, eating corn bread
I just fucked a black chick, yeah, I'm proud
If that's racist, suck a black dick
I'm the one who going straight to the top
Don't mistake it, it's not that flagrant when you blatantly flop
And plus I stay down, like my date gown in this bitch
I'm about to hit the playground, straight clown, all these kids
I'm watching ladybugs with your lady, I got it made like that
Cleaning house like a maid might rap
I don't play with you lame type cats
Say the same shit for days, motherfucker, if you cold I got flames
You're the ice caps

I'm just saying that lil David is coming, got Perrier in abundance
I'm with a bitch who pushing fingers down
That's saying she want it
Don't look it's head up on the table, label that seven nothing
I'm faded snacking on Funyuns, while making raps
That's a luncheon
I'm packing a punch and packing lunch and packed in incumbents
Rapping dumber than some tackle football
With no pads to a motherla
That's how you know it's going down
Philly D, so you know I keep that Hoagie around
Philly beef, we don't fuck with that baloney clown
Y'all made a mess, let me just push that old Zamboni around
That's for hockey if you curious
Treat you like my bitches, only peep between the periods
Treat you like my dishes, only need you when I mentioned
To be eating something viscous, y'all deliciously inferior
Dicky sicker than Nigeria
All types of health issues over there, lot of AIDS
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, please, don't fuck with me
I wouldn't like it at all
I'm about to buy a monkey and just chill with him
Like in three years, buy a monkey and just chill with him
Dressing him well as fuck, like, throwing overalls on that monkey
Naming him some shit like Greg, like some normal ass name
Like just Greg and, and like, and like really develop a strong
A strong relationship with the monkey
I assume he become one of my better friends
Professional Rapper coming out this fall, I feel bad for the game
I feel the hope sometimes I just feel bad for the game
They ain't ready, woah, I, I just got a fucking Hinge match
Like throwing that out, y'all, just got a Hinge match, y'all on Hinge
It's really irresponsible not to be, it's just free pussy

And I've been looking at other rappers swag
And being intimidated by it, but like why
I'm an impressive young man

And I'm 'bout to get money
Although I ain't joking, America also agree that I'm funny

But I fuck with rap, real shit, bro, I fuck with rap

I talk about somebody cock and I buzz off that
Know I'm saying I'm the man right now
Act like ya man playing right now
Act like I ain't get hundred granding in from the fans right now
Act like I ain't planned that out
Act like I'm not about to get them bitches from the mag
Picture that right, cauce I rap nice, I'm attractive to that type
Living that life and I'm naturally that likeable
That right dimple, not like the left, but it's barely worse
Bitches playing marry, fuck, kill, inevitably become Mz. Burd
Go head and fuck them, I'm real and my jumper is ill
Y'all got swag, but I got reservations
Ya just boys and I'm the voice of my generation
Like I really belive that, like I think I'd get us
Run it back, homie talking shit, pipe down
I don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now
You can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight
I've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right
Swagga on a hundred milligram, I can play the villain, fam
Put your boy in any room, I swear to God he still the man
Lil homie, I am Obama
You the man among some bitches, bunch of lying Juwannas
Flex, run it back, homie talking shit pipe down
I don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now
You can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight
I've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right
I ain't cocky I'm right, I ain't cocky I'm right
Everything I say I do and I ain't stopping tonight
Swagga, swagga, swagga, swagaa
That's really fun to say like that, y'all should try it
If you ever get some free time, or on my level
I never done acting, but somehow, I still get auditions for movies
The last one I went after Bob Odenkirk
And that's Saul if you clueless
The way they react to my rapping
It show me, it's bigger than music
At shows they be laughing, then dancing
They never seen anyone do this
Come fuck with that
Lil ho, come fuck with that
Was in the number one department in the country
I was one up in my class, coulda run with that
Biz week, coulda run with that, then Lil D had a run with ads
Lil D wrote couple for the League, got them on TV
Then was done with that, y'all high I'm matterhorn
And no offense I matter more
The Rec League, like Steve, LD winning back to back
With scattered blacks, then smack y'all in scattegories
You in a trash, like category, I'm getting ass no statutory
You seeing red I'm matadoring
Ya rap is boring and wack deplorable
Lack the morals that make mine allegorical
I'm the motherfucking man of my time right now
Got ya whole team looking at the man, like damn
That's LeBron, that's Durant, that's Assange
That's your aunt, on my cock, say I can't
Even parents fucking with me
Bro, I'm so comfy with myself, but here snuggle with me
Like please, come here and snuggle
See what the fuck happen to you, you gon' like it, I'm real warm
I shift my weight, so your legs won't fall asleep
I didn't even mention how nice I was at tennis neither
So, don't forget about that
Lemme freak! I don't give a damn what you playin right now, this is me comin at you as a man right now, lemme freak
I'm talkin to ya lemme freak Goddamn it lemme freak, just lemme freak
Girl I smell that pussy across the room
There's no disrespect, they could make that shit perfume
Oh good God, I'm nasty
Don't look around girl, I'm lookin at you
What's good I'm Dave
What's your name Where you from Who you with
What's your policy on birth control When were you last tested Girl I gotta know
If you gon let me hit it raw, you gotta go
That would be crazy irresponsible
You know I only get with a bitch I mentally respect
We ain't even gotta fuck unless you and me connect
Minimally I'd like to ejaculate somehow though
Girl, I don't think I'm being unreasonable unless you that naive, that you thought this was a friend thing
I hope you not a freak so don't moan and spool your body soak and wet
My bad, I know I sweat profusely
Also, I won't fuck from the side girl, I'd lose like half my dick
Are you good about the pill
Cuz even if it's foreplay, I should know that shits for real, girl I got hella pre-cum
Also, I'm wondering bout the way that you cum
Like is it external stimulation or penetration-based Fuck it
You know I enjoy that way
But you know damn well, I just want my bed
They gon say I fell, I got blown away
I'm a hopeless romantic, girl I'm being dramatic but it's just the truth
Wait hold up, I should slow down
Don't even know you enough to go down
But if you want it we should go now
And we gon find out if it's great or it's strange
Oh girl, I could get you 4 to 8 minutes
Won't force the issue
Bitch it's too crowded
So girl if you bad then just give me that signal
But make it a loud one, I'm awful at this, hoe on the low, you [fire] cut the shit
Girl what you tryin to do
I got candles, Nonpareils, and three condoms in my room
The Nonpareils might be old as shit
Like they've been in there for a while
But fact of the matter is I don't want this to be no blip
I'd prefer to fall in love or swear I'm on some crazy shit. crazy shit
Like honestly, I need someone to save the kid. save the kid
It could be you but first you gotta let me freak, just lemme freak, just lemme freak again
Girl, what's wrong with you
I need to freak
I need to freak
I need to freak
Like please let me freak
Like please let me freak
Please let me freak right now
Please lemme freak, lemme freak right now
Girl we could get married
Like we could be fuckin
A daughter named Bailey
That barely
We gon eat so many goddamn meals
What's your name
Girl, you better keep them dirty paws off my chicken lo mein
We'll talk the boundaries out together is all I'm sayin
And for the record girl I'll eat that pussy later
Like when I know you a little bit better
But for now it's just too intimate
Like it's too much
You don't even have to give me head either
Like I'm totally onboard with a hand job
Especially if there's like lube or some shit around
In a weird way, I actually prefer it to head
There's no guilt
No guilt at all
In fact, it feels just as good to me too if not better
I think it's a dick sensitivity issue
At the same time, there's no way you should complain about such a thing
Actually, you know what...
I don't, I-I will say one thing. I'd rather you sleep in a hotel downtown than sleep at your friend's house. You need a good night's sleep.
Ha, why
Well, because you're gonna get up and perform, honey.
Yeah, I mean...
You need, you just, I guess I just think you're underestimating...
I know you're gonna perform, you're gonna perform 3 shows in 4 nights.
Yeah.
You know, you don't wanna get sick. You don't wanna have a cold, you don't, you know. I'm trying not to be a Jewish mother, here, but I think you're really underestimating this.
No, you guys are handling it, I'd say you're playing your role great as the, the Jewish parents of a rapper. I'm curious to hear the conversations that happen between other rappers and their parents, I think these are interesting.
What do you mean by that, David
What do you mean what do I mean by that
When you say we're handling our role, you think we're being, uh, we're being sarcastic
No, I-I enjoy it, I think it's funny. I'm just saying, like, I can't imagine, like, Puff Daddy or something talking to his mom and she's telling him, like, You better get a good night's sleep, you can't catch a cold.
I-I, you know what, actually, you're gonna laugh at me. I disagree with you, I think anybody's mother would do that.
Ok.
And when Puff Daddy was 25 years old and the night before he was performing, I'm sure somebody was telling him the same thing. That's what mothers do. Black, white, Indian, it doesn't matter who we are.
I respect that, but Jewish mothers a little more.
Yeah, Jewish mothers maybe a tad more.
Hi, I'm Dave
I'm Strange no
I've been up so long
Don't know where ill go don't know what I know I'm wrong
I must be gone gone I must be gone gone
I'll play my god
What you doing
Like everything
Don't shoot down my pair of wings
Let me just smoke my Mary Jane
Ill just hold my marriage in
And that coin flip so damn american
Ever take a walk in the street
Sit up in the middle of the median
And they come and go and they come and go
And my shit been bumpin' my shit been dope
But I'm missing something I'm kissing hoes
And I'm missing something I'm switching rolls
And I'm pissed at something I'm drifting slow
I got zip files
And I know if I click them they gonna unlock
How do I know that though I wasn't taught
I guess that shit that you learn on the job
And my permanent fog is burning like smog
Look at your feet totally odd
What is a feat what is a job
Look at my teeth and they been moving a bit
So as of late I've got in my retainer but dawg
Sooner or later the pain is a problem
Only its not only its not
That mean its working I guess I'm like god
I don't ever front out here for a minute go crazy
Oh my god oh my god
I can't even stop this song
Now the kid been getting bananas
He going Donkey Kong
King of the ape shit
He going Donkey Kong
King of the ape shit
I earned shit while he learned quick
Churned shit while he cursed this
And I turned around like I heard something
But i swear to god I ain't heard nothing
I second guessed you but escalated
Shit ready when I'm done renovating
Don't fuck with me on my escapade
Don't fuck with me on my escapade
And I met a boy on that mountain top
And he said to me go round the block
And I did that and I came back and he took back what I took back
I stood back while he took that
And I looked back while he looked at me
And that's when I knew I was on
Shouldn't be long
I keep it moving along
I keep on proving you wrong
I keep on doing the shit that you want me to do
It don't have to be public at all
It will be our little secrete
Unless you do songs about it
Hmm but why would you do that
Well...
I don't ever front out here for a minute go crazy
Oh my god oh my god
I can't even stop this song
Now the kid been getting bananas
He going Donkey Kong
King of the ape shit
He going Donkey Kong
King of the ape shit
My own boss

Man, she always taking the most
Conference room every day is the worst

I hate your demanding
To print some shit, but you don't even know
Now look what happened, now who rapping
Now at work I ask to look at bitches' titties then this happens
Titties looking back at me like Dicky, boy, what's cracking
I look back at titties like I need a sec, I'm rapping
Titties looking back at me like, take your time, you snapping
I'm like, woo, I'm getting paid for that
I'm getting paid for that
Nah, I'm getting paid for that
I'm getting paid for that
Nah, I'm getting paid for that
All of these hoes been on me
I'll never go back homie
Homie last week I was up in Miami
Got paid to chill in the club
Literally, chilling, like not even rapping
I think I did a good job
Sat down on Twitter, my new correspondence
Is going through all of these wonderful compliments
Used to be scrutinized in all these documents
Now when I sign off on something, it's body parts
Titty, booty, macking a cutie
Got a bag in the back of the room of the venue cause she copped that meet and greet
I got them going down in their prime like Aaliyah be
Used to post up, on time, no brakes
Got a purp poster on the vine, no grapes
Used to have to swallow all the pride
Had to piss out the slacks of the sack in the sweats every day
Used to buy brands, now the brands pay Dave
Like, I just got a box of Pumas, cause they think I'm cool
Watch me mention StarKist Tuna, watch my friends get full
I used to sit and wait for Friday
But now my whole week like a Friday
I'm getting paid for that
Nah, I'm getting paid for that
I'm getting paid for that
Nah, I'm getting paid for that
All of these hoes been on me
I'll never go back homie
Last year I'm stuck up doing shit up in a cubicle
They tell me what to do, I'm thinking fuck that shit
But y'all, I couldn't tell them what the fuck I'm thinking
Now they're paying just to listen to this shit, I got up on my leg
Got three or four bitches who 'bout to get the fourth down
That's a first, I remember when what lunch I picked was all I get
My bitch make that coffee, now only boss me around when we fuck
Was missing college but now they bringing me back, it's still fun
God damn Dicky, you too old to be fucking all these kids
Yeah, I know, but if you can rap, it's a lot less creepy though
I'm smoking weed in public, but it never seem to matter
Dump a bottle of water on your clothes and you ecstatic
I don't ever have to set alarms, I wake up supernatural
I can grab a bitch's hand and she will scream you so attractive
How did this happen
I'm getting paid for that
Nah, I'm getting paid for that
I'm getting paid for that
Nah, I'm getting paid for that
All of these hoes been on me
I'll never go back homie
I used to be up in Excel every day with a bitch very proficient
Now I just suck on my dick, suck on my own dick, man
I suck on my own dick, every rapper do it
Just a thing, an inside thing I learned
It's absurd, it's like, I'm in the industry now, so, I'm seeing shit
Every rapper suck they own dick, it's not just me
Swear to God on the Bible
Aiyyo fam, check this out
I was just at the club right?
Heard these two dudes talkin
One of them said to the other one
that they knew someone, who said you guys are WACK!
Who said we're wack? You said we're wack?
You take it back! Who said we're wack?
You talkin smack? You're gonna get smacked!
You sayin that I'm wack but it just ain't so
Someone said we're wack, why would they say that?
I don't think we're wack, who said we're wack?
Who said we're wack? I can't believe that
They must be smokin crack, to say that we're wack
Say that we're wack, you probably get smacked
if you say we're wack, did you say we're wack?
WHO SAID WE'RE WACK? I'll paint your eye black!
Won'tcha check my facts - who said we're wack?
How could a person up and call a person wack?
How could the devil turn the blue sky black?
How many babies born will never reach their dreams?
And how could a person call another person wack?
I heard a rumor that somebody said we're wack
I think that's wack, to call someone wack
I AM NOT WACK, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
WHAT DID YOU SAY? DID YOU SAY I'M WACK?!
All the ladies in the house put your hands up
All the fellas in the house put your hands up
Now whoever said we're wack put your hand up
Now everyone else, put your hands down
Oh there he is, there he is!
What is that, Cristal? No!
Dom P? Hell no!
This is that Carlos Santana champagne!
Oh shit, Santana DVX? That's my joint!
Mine too, but a lot of these busters don't know about it
WELL LET'S TELL THESE MOTHERFUCKERS!
As a kid, I used to lay awake and think
When was Santana gonna make a drink?
But now I'm all grown and my dream came true
Santana champagne, from here to you
From the heart of Napa Valley and the guitar king
Comes a sparkling wine, to make a blind man sing
Yo it's the cham-pan-yah, from the man with the bandana
I can't stand a flute with anything but Santana
What's the first name in cham - it's Carlos
And to that man I propose a toast
In the 60's, he had lots of freebie sex
But now he's gettin down with the DVX
Excuse me fellas!
Am I to understand that Carlos Santana has made a champagne?
That's right motherfucker! Here, try it
Alright pops bottle AWWWWWWWWW SHIT!
I feel alive for the first time
Each sip hits my lips like a landmine
Without Carlos in my life I was livin a lie
He makes his guitar weep, but his champagne cries
He's a Southwest, tie wearin bolo champ
Comin straight out the box with a bolo champ'
Yo he a beast with the sugar and yeast, mix it in pots
Like the way his release mixed jazz blues and pops
And the salsa fusion, he's lady's shoe producin
Plus he teamed with Rob Thomas for a music revolution
On the 7th day, it was said God rest
But on the 8th day he made the DVX
Gentlemen, gentlemen, what is all the hubbub about?
Carlos Santana! That's right
I see bitches-is enjoyin my sparkling wine
We certainly are Well be careful
cause this shit'll get you fucked up
Bitch!
I'm like no other, one of a kind, my sparkling wine
Santana DVX make you wanna have sex OOOOH
I'm rich bitch! I'm havin my chips
Get laid all the time, by 70's chicks - uhh
Won hella Grammies, batches throw me they panties
I'm probably your daddy, I probably nutted in your mammy
I'm a Bay boy, city life, been around the corner
Try to play me foul and my vatos gon' run up on ya
A legend, a boss, that's what I are
Ask about me pimp, 'tana be killin the guitar
Old enough to know better but young enough to not care
I get active - might slap a bitch with my hair WHIP
Left coast up top I bang that shit
My sparkling wine'll pop Cristal on her lip
Cain't stop, won't stop gettin my bread
Pack arenas and coliseums now watch me shred
Ohhhh, San-tan-tan-tan-ahhhh
A monkey drank a bottle and learned to speak
A queer drank a bottle and became a freak
A lion drank a bottle and forgot how to growl
A horse drank a bottle, and fucked a cow!Lock eyes from across the room
Down my drink while the rhythms boom
Take your hand and skip the names
No need here for the silly games
Make our way through the smoke and crowd
The club is the sky and I'm on your cloud
Move in close as the lasers fly
Our bodies touch and the angels cry
Leave this place go back to yours
Our lips first touch outside your doors
The whole night what we've got in store
Whisper in my ear that you want some more
And I
Jizz in my pants
This really never happens you can take my word
I won't apologise, that's just absurd
Mainly your fault from the way that you dance
And now I
Jizz in my pants
Don't tell your friends or I'll say you're a slut
Plus it's your fault, you were rubbing my butt
I'm very sensitive, some would say that's a plus
Now I'll go home and change
I need a few things from the grocery
Do things alone now mostly
Left me heart-broken not lookin' for love
Surprise in my eyes when I looked above
The check-out counter and I saw a face
My heart stood still so did time and space
Never felt that I could feel real again
But the look in her eyes said I need a friend
She turned to me that's when she said it
Looked me dead in the face, asked, "Cash or credit?"
And I
Jizzed in my pants
It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me
But we're going to need a clean up on aisle 3
And now I'm posed in an awkward stance because I
Jizzed in my pants
To be fair you were flirting a lot
Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot
Please stop acting like you're not impressed
One more thing, I'm gonna pay by check
Last week I saw a film
As I recall it was a horror film
Walked outside into the rain
Checked my phone and saw you rang and I
Jizzed in my pants
Speeding down the street when the red lights flash
Need to get away need to make a dash
A song comes on that reminds me of you and I
Jizz in my pants
The next day my alarm goes off and I
Jizz in my pants
Open my window and a breeze rolls in and I
Jizz in my pants
When Bruce Willis was dead at the end of Sixth Sense I
Jizzed in my pants
I just ate a grape and I
Jizzed in my pants
I went
Jizzed in my pants
OK, seriously you guys can we, OK?
I jizz right in my pants every time you're next to me
And when we're holding hands it's like having sex to me
You say I'm premature I just call it ecstasy
I wear a rubber at all times it's a necessity
'Cause I
Jizz in my pants
I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants, yes I jizz in my pants, yes I jizz in my pants
Yes I jizz in my pants
I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants

Who said we're wack? Who said we're wack?
You take it back - who said we're wack?
Thank you very much
Imagine in your mind a posh country club
The stuffy old money where the poor kid's snubbed
The spread is bland: sauerkraut and boiled goose
There's no way these people will ever cut loose
But then I walk in the room, hold my boombox high
And what happened next, will blow your mind
Everything got outta control
The music was so entrancing
Everyone got out on the floor
It was a bunch of old white people dancing
Now picture if you will a bunch of business men
Stuffed in the boardroom like pigs in a pen
The ties around the necks are like a hangman's noose
In the middle of the table there's a boiled goose
The old people smell makes you want to puke in the sink
These dudes will never dance - yeah, that's what you think
I stride in the room all young and hip
Hold up my boombox and say listen to this
Then everyone started to move
People rejoiced instead of financing
Your preconceived notions were shattered
By the super old white people dancing
The big apple, where people never dance
Spirits go down while profits expand
The cops or the dealers, who's got the juice?
The street vendors peddling their boiled goose
So many types of people will never get along
Till I bust out my boombox and play this song
The music washed away all the hate
And society started advancing
Every demographic was represented
It was a rainbow coalition of dancing
Whoa!
Everyone was wearing fingerless gloves
Whoaaaaaoaaaaaoh!
I saw a Spanish guy doing the Bartman
Transport now to an old folks home
Where the elderly are tossed on their brittle bones
The orderlies are stealing; there's no excuse!
Everyday for lunch they eat boiled goose
So I grabbed my boombox and hit the turbo bass
And what happened next was a total disgrace
Everybody started having sex
The music was way too powerful
A bunch of old people fucking like rabbits
It was disgusting to say the least
Oh!
A boombox can change the world
You gotta know your limits with a boombox
This was a cautionary tale
A boombox is not a toy
Mr. Samberg, thanks for coming to your performance review.
No problem.
So you're in charge around here, is that fair to say?
Absolutely, I'm the boss.
OK, so take us through a day in the life of "The Boss".
Well the first thing I do is

Jump out the window like a boss

Crash into the sun like a boss
Now I'm dead like a boss
Uh huh. So that's an average day for you then.
No doubt.
You chop your balls off and die.
Hell yeah.
And I think at one point there you said something about sucking your own dick?
Nope.
Actually, I'm pretty sure you did.
Nah, that ain't me.
OK, well this has been eye-opening for me.
I'm the boss.
Ya, I know, I got that. You said it about 400 times.
I'm the boss.
Ya, ya, I got it.
I'm the boss.
No, I heard you, see you later!
like a boss
 Hi, do you want to go to a party with me?
 No. The game's on.
 Oh, I almost forgot. I'll be right there.
We like sportz and we don't care who knows
From shooting hoops, to the Super Bowl
We like sportz and we don't care who knows
Football Football Football. Tennis. Hockey. Golf.
The game is starting everyone is here,
I got my snacks, my friends, and a beer
Just two normal guyz hanging out having fun
Kiv: Right guy number 2?
Jorma: Yeah guy number 1.
E to the S to the P to the N
Is all I watch cause I'm the man
If my team loses I'll be mean all night
If you tell me to relax we'll get in a fight
Watching sportz with girls is a pain
They don't know the rules; there's no time to explain
Single, double, triple, home-run
For the celebration I'll shoot my gun
I like my friend, he's a real guys guy
He's not a loud-mouth like that cunt-hole Steve
We like sportz and we don't care who knows
From Wimbledon to the Astrodome
We like sportz and we don't care who knows
Football Football Football. Tennis. Hockey. Golf.
Now when I say "sportz", you say "nutz"
"Sportz!"
"Nutz!"
"Sportz!"
"Nutz!"
When I say "cheating", you say "sux"
"Cheating!"
"Sux!"
"Cheating!"
"Sux!"
I drink whiskey cause I like the taste
You think its bitter but I think its great
I also drink whiskey and we smoke cigars
Don't believe me? Smell our cars
We're real men, and we like sportz
If you say we're not then we'll see you in court
Jorma: I'm team captain and I choose you
Kiv: I'm the other team captain and I choose you too
We steal the ball and we're off to the races
Then scare the other team with our mad dog faces like,
What what what what what what.
What what what what what what.
We like sportz and we don't care who knows
From the pregame jokes to the wrap-up show
We like sportz and we don't care who knows
Football Football Football. Tennis. Hockey. Golf.

You came to the right place my man
Get ready, here we go
New Shit! 
Welcome my friends to the old saloon
Everyone in town is hangin out
If you got a drink, well you drink it down
Then we'll all go have sex with the whoever! 
Brand new! 
Buffalo Bill, I just rode into town
On my horse, you betcha on a horse
That's the thing in the old west times, 
Everyone enjoys a good horse ride
If you cheat at cards ya get thrown out! 
Right out the saloon doors on your butt
Go back in and buy a round of whiskey
Guess what? All is forgiven! 
DJ LARRY! 
Well look who's here, it's Calamity Jane
And you're another guy who's probly an injun! 
This whiskey's warm and it tastes like piss! 
DJ LARRY! 
Oh no! My stash smells like piss! 
So that's your story, stickin to it
The old wild west is no place for a lady
I'm the bartender, but I'm also the mayor
So just put that in your pipe and smoke it
DJ waaahaa! 
Tiny Tim and it's almost Christmas, 
Sure is dusty here.
These days, a lot a cats is outta line 
Seems to me, like they need to get punched 
Yeah, but where you gonna punch em? 
Yo, the choice is obvious 
I'll punch you in the jeans 
I'll punch you in the jeans 
This is not a case of man vs machine 
You think that you're safe, thought you got away clean? 
I'll roll up on you smooth and punch you in the jeans 
I got my fists clenched, gonna throw a haymaka 
Rockin your slacks from here to jaimaica 
Shake in your boots, cuz I'm the earthquaka 
Bringin those jeans round here was a mistaka 
I gotta vendetta, it's against your jeans yeah 
Gonna put my knuckles up against the seams 
They can be on your legs or on the clothesline 
But when I see the zipper and cloth, it's go time! 
And I'm zeroed in, I got the tunnel vision 
Gonna cover you in shit like a ton of pigeons 
Man I hate your jeans, I'm gonna bruise that denim 
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in em' 
Yo we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before 
Best believe this is not a metaphor 
Better watch your back, cuz we're on the creep 
And we won't stop till your jeans are six feet deep! 
Man I'll murder your jeans, I'll feed em to the fishes 
Heres what I'd do, if I had three wishes 
Punch your jeans, on all three counts 
It would bring me satisfaction in large amounts 
If I had three wishes I would do the same 
We see eye to eye in this jean punch game 
I'd lay em in a field, where there's chemical sprayin 
But I'd punch em first, yo that goes without sayin yeah 
Acid wash pleats or a nifty cuff 
It's just another jean for my fist to stuff 
Throwin fistacuffs, eat pants like bag lunches 
Jeans pronounced dead 
Cause of death? 
Hecka punches! 
Yo we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before 
Best believe this is not a metaphor 
You got somethin to say, we got the proper retorts 
Beat your jeans so bad that they'll wish they were shorts 
Gonna revise your Levi's with physical harm 
Put divets in the rivets with my physical arm 
Gonna beat those jeans, gonna dip em in slime 
Turn your 501s into 499s 
When I punch a jean I like to imagine a face 
The fly is the nose and the balls are the base of the face 
You got taste and it shows my man 
God damn your jean brand got me throwin my hands 
Gonna go back in time, find the man who made jeans 
And choke him to death, if you know what I mean 
Yo I know what you mean, so keep your jeans on a hush 
Breakout, before you get bumrushed 
Yo we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before 
Best believe this is not a metaphor 
So take off your jeans, and reverse the curse 
Cuz we the best jean punchers in the universe 
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in em' x2

Reach for the stars! 
You stand on a distant planet 
Skyline of red plateaus 
Strange air and vegetation 
You're a winner! 
Welcome to the Space Olympics 
The year Thirty Twenty Two 
Take part in a grand tradition 
Your name echoes in the holes of the universe! 
Believe in yourself! 
Take your game into outer space! 
Every single galactic athlete 
Needs a coded ID badge 
Drug tests are mandatory 
You're a winner! 
The Athlete's Village is on Zargon 
You all get a junior suite 
We don't cover incidentals 
So keep your ass off the minibar! 
You're the best in the world! 
Brace yourself 'cause there's no gravity! 
You're in the motherfuckin' Space Olympics! 
Let it be known by every nation 
You'll only get one meal a day 
There was a bit of a budget SNAFU 
And food funding is insufficient 
We can't really enforce a curfew 
As there is no light or sound 
Just one of the many problems 
With hosting a sporting event in space. 
Attention all athletes. There are minor scheduling adjustments. 
Space Disc! Is totally cancelled. 
Space Swords! Is totally cancelled. 
Space Luge! Is also cancelled. 
And all other events are pending! 
Welcome to your Space Olympics 
All the oxygen has run out 
And someone who will not be named 
Accidentally hit self-destruct 
As you file to your escape pods 
I'll distract the alien hordes 
And as I stare death in the face I know my sins will take me to hell. 
You do it for the love 
My love 
And there ain't no woman that could take your spot my love
I don't sleep, motherfucker, off that 'gnac and the bourbon
Doing 120 getting head while I'm swerving
Damn, Natalie, you a crazy chick
Yo, shut the fuck up and suck my dick
I bust in dudes' mouths like gushers motherfucker
Pull up on NBC and smack the shit outta Jeff Zucker
What you want Natalie? To drink and fight!
What you need Natalie? To fuck all night!
Don't test me when I'm crazy off that airplane glue
Put my foot down your throat 'til your shit's in my shoe
Leave you screaming, pay for my dry-cleaning
Fuck your man it's my name that he's screaming!
All the kids looking up to me can suck my dick
It's Portman motherfucker, drink 'til I'm sick
Slit your throat and pour nitrous down the hole
Watch you laugh and cry; while I laugh, you die
And all the dudes, you know I'm talking to you
We love you Natalie! I wanna fuck you too!
P! It's for Portman! P! It's for pussy!
I'll kill your fucking dog for fun, so don't push me
When I was in Harvard I smoked weed everyday
I cheated every test and snorted all the yay
I got a def posse, you got a bunch of dudes
I sit right down on your face and take a shit
Natalie, you are a bad ass bitch hell yeah!
And I always pay for your dry-cleaning
When my shit gets in your shoe What!
And as for the drug use
Well, I can't vouch for that,
My dick is scared of you ooh
Nowwwwwww let's take a trip down memory lane
Back to junior high school where it all begain
Three bad little kids raisin hell at school
We were just 13, straight actin the fool
Every day after class Kiva's house was the spot
Makin crazy prank calls hopin not to get caught
Best friends, blood brothers, yo we one and the same
'Til one fateful afternoon when everything changed
One day playin Punch Out up and came doom
The house started shakin and we heard a kaboom
Looked out the back window saw billowin smoke
Yo your backyard is smashed - man this isn't a joke!
Yo let's go check this out man Aight bet, let's go
All the smoke and debris led straight to the basement
Yo what the hell is that? Man it looks like a spaceship
We all ran for cover, as the hatch opened wide
And a little green dude stepped out from inside; he said
Little Green Dude
I'm from Mars, and I come in peace
I have something to ask, and it's not discrete
There's a mutated strain in our DNA helix
And you three kids are the ones who can heal it
But we're just 13 man, what can we do?
Umm how should I put this? I think we should screw
What?! On my home planet we can no longer breed
I've been sent as a receptacle to store your seed
Storin our seed? - Yo I think he means sex
Man I'm a virgin - we all are - BET!
I'm just gonna lie here and close my eyes
Aww what should we do? Now he's spreading his thighs!
You'll be heroes on our planet But why us 3?
You're the chosen ones, you'll just have to trust me
Okay, we're in cool who should go first?
I have three depositories to capture your burst
Wait, so at the same time? Yeah that's what I was thinking
Here's some wine coolers, let's get you boys drinking
We pounded the drinks and, started gettin tipsy
Then took our positions, and started gettin frisky
One in the front, and two in the back
Had it locked up like a Chinese finger trap
Keep pumping away, my wife and family thank you
I'm about to explode - yo son, me too
THREE-WAY CLIMAX, best friends forever
What a blessing to have lost our virginity together
Yeah!
Andy, Jorma, Kiv', you've saved my race
Your reward is one wish then I'll go back to space
We looked at each other, didn't have to talk
Knew exactly what we wanted, before he took off
Mr. Alien Sir, for what it's worth
WE WANT TO BE THE GREATEST FAKE MC'S ON EARTH
Your wish is granted and thanks again
I may have saved my planet but I'm losing three friends
What happened today was both incredible and bad
Therefore your name is Incredibad!
This one goes out 
From the bottom of our hearts
To the most important lady in our lives
It's time to pay some respect
I hope you proud of us
'Cause we're proud of you
Mama!
You raised me right
Mama!
Showed me the light
Mama!
Through pain and strife
Mama! 
You gave us life
When I fell down you were there to pick me up
When I felt bad you were there to build me up
Gave everything you had in the world to me
And you made me the man I'm supposed to be
Jane, even though I don't say it often enough
I appreciate everything you did for us
Never take you for granted 'cause it ain't hard to see
The best parts of you are now a part of me
Ah Mama
And when it was cold outside you kept us warm and held us down...
Mom Hi boys, who wants a snack?
Andy MOM, GET OUT WE'RE IN THE STUDIO!
Jorma OH MY GOD!
Mom Just checking on my guys!

I'll always be there to wipe a tear from your eye
My mom's my number one fan, my best friend
And I'll never disrespect...
Door opens
Jorma MOM!

window smashes
Mom Watch it
Andy I HOPE YOU FUCKING DIE!
Jump in front of a bullet if it could save my mom
You got a ? bullet 'cause she will never see harm...
Door opens
Mom Nevermind, I found it
They all scream/shout/glass smashes
'Dale' Laura, everything ok?
Andy SHUT THE FUCK UP DALE!
Jorma SHUT UP!
Mom Hey! Be nice to Dale
Andy FUCK DALE!
Jorma FUCK DALE!
Andy I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE SEX WITH THAT GUY!
This goes out to all the mamas 
Trying to protect their kids from drama
Love was your goal to bring?
No matter what they say, you're beautifull
So push them lighters in the sky
Wave 'em back from side to side
And if you feel lost and alone
Let our voices guide you home
Mom Is something burning down there?
Andy GET THE FUCK OUT NOW!
Sometimes Oooooh
Something beautiful happens
In this world Akon
You don't know how to
Express yourself so and Lonely Island
You just gotta sing
I just had sex
And it felt so good Felt so good
A woman let me put
My penis inside of her
I just had sex
And I'll never go back Never go back
To the not-having-sex
Ways of the past
Have you ever had sex?
I have it felt great
It felt so good
When I did it with my penis
A girl let me do it
It literally just happened
Having sex can make a nice
Man out of the meanest
Never guess where I just came from
I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling
It was the best
When I had the sex
Man my penis felt great
And I called my parents
Right after I was done
Oh hey, didn't see you there
Guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed
Saw her boobies and the rest
Was sure nice of her to let you
Do that thing
Nice of any girl ever
Now sing
I just had sex
And it felt so good Felt so good
A woman let me put
My penis inside of her
I wanna tell the world
To be honest I'm surprised
She even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense
But man, screw it
I ain't one to argue
With a good thing
She could be my wife
That good?
The best 30 seconds of my life My life
I'm so humbled by a girls ability
To let me do her
Cuz honestly I'd have sex
With a pile of manure
With that in mind
The soft, nice smelling girls better
Cuz she let me wear
My chain and turtle neck sweater
So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them
If you're near or far
Whether short or tall
We wanna thank you all
For letting us fuck you
She kept looking at her watch
Doesn't matter, had sex
But I cried the whole time
Doesn't matter, had sex
I think she might've been a racist
Doesn't matter, had sex
She put a bag on my head
Still counts
I just had sex Sex
And all my dreams came true Dreams came true
So if you had sex in the last
30 minutes then you're qualified
To sing with me
I just had sex Everybody sing
And it felt so good We all had sex
A woman let me put
My penis inside of her I wanna tell the world
I just had sex
And I'll never go back No no no
To the not-having-sex
Ways of the past
Here's a little story that I think you'll like
It's not about Shaq or Iron Mike
So buckle your seatbelts, it's gonna get choppy
And listen to the tale of the time I fought Rocky
One day me and all my friends were hangin'
Talkin' 'bout which of the girls was most bangin'
Then one friend says, "You know who's really tough?
"Rocky," hit me home "the boxer." Man,
I said, "Yeah I know him. What about him?" He said, 
"He's really tough." "No way, man. I'm calling your bluff
"I think that I can take him and, to prove my point,
"I'll challenge him in public." Yeah, that's the joint!
So the very next day, stayed true to my word
And I snuck on T.V. so I could be heard
I said, 'Rocky, if you're out there, I think you're a nerd.
"And I'll lick you and bury you like a dog turd!"
I got kicked out, but the candle was lit
'Cause the people had to know if my claim was legit
It made the headlines and I got the call
It was Rocky "Hey" and he wanted to brawl
We negotiated terms and set the date
Then I went into training to add some muscle weight
While I punched on meat in a rickety shack
He was sippin' on wine, having models rub his back
At the weigh-in, boy the tension was high
Me and Rock, toe-to-toe and eye-to-eye
I talked some trash, we got pulled apart
I shot him one last look to strike fear in his heart
Skip ahead, the big night was finally here
My body was ripped and my mind was clear
We entered the arena to the roar of the crowd
People chantin' my name - I never felt so proud
Faced off once more in the center of the ring
Touched gloves, said a prayer and the bell went *ding*
He hit me with a left and shattered my face
And a right sent my teeth all over the place
Then another great punch caved-in my eye socket
He broke my jaw and my trainer yelled, "Stop it!"
But nobody heard him and he crushed my ribs
Blood sprayed off my face and onto some kids
They yelled out, "More!" and Rocky obliged
I had to think of some way to turn the tides
So I leaned back to hit him with all of my might
Took a swing, but he caught me with a sucker punch right
Then a sucker punch left and a sucker punch right
Then twenty-two consecutive sucker punch rights
He tore off my arms and beat me with 'em
Then threw acid in my face which obscured my vision
He kicked me in the leg and fractured my shin
The bone splinters shot right out of my skin
People barfed in the crowd; they were going insane
And Rocky punched my nose-bone into my brain
I was quivering and twitching when I soiled my shorts
Then Rocky pissed on me customary in sports
The doctor came out and pronounced me dead
And that was the night I fought Rocky
My turtleneck fat and my chain so thin,
N' I'm sippin' light beer, n my crew right here
Chain razor thin like beer in my cup,
And my sweater on turtle with the neck on puff
Huge turtle neck and my chain so skinny
Beer light all night, stand up get dizzy
Light cup, beer drink, thin so chain, neck turtle fat, man I won't say it again
Turtle neck check with another on deck
Incase I spill something on it like some light beer? Yes.
We be braggin' bout whose chain is the thinnest
Turtle neck thicker than Delta Burke swimmin' in a Guinness now bear witness
But they can't see my chain,
Metal so thin it dissolve when it rain
Got more chains than the snow patrol
Everyone razor thin like an insect stripper pole
Chain so light when a breeze roll by, man it float man it float 
And my beer so light you could see right through it, like a ghost
And I also wear turtle necks
Sweaters swallowing my chain like it's stuck in the couch
Looking like cookie monster flossin' his mouth
Find me coolin' on the corner sippn' light beer foam
You can tell by my turtle neck and chain that I bone
Turtleneck, light beer, n' a thin ass chain, n' that's it
The rabbit kicked the bucket, dog said fuck it,
Get my 2 step on, with my turtle neck on
Thin ass chain, like beer in my glass
Mackin at the bitches, the ones with the ass
Girl you know it's true, tell me what it do
Oh you like my style, say you like my crew
Say you wanna' be under my chest, this turtle neck is like one of my best x2
So I guess your dress, no stress, stayin' fresh as my bandana
Ima crook, so my look, Ima game go getta
The fatter the puppy, get the fluffy, get the bigger the turtleneck,
The more gangster it is
 Oh dang.
 What is it dawg?
 I forgot it's Mother's Day.
 Didn't get a gift for her.
 Other plans got in the way. She'll be so disappointed.
 Damn I forgot it too.
 This could have been avoided.
 What the hell are we gonna do?
 My mom's been so alone ever since my daddy left.
 Cold.
 No one to hold her tight. Life has put her to the test.
 I know just what you mean, my mom's been so sad and gray.
 Word
 My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom ever since he passed away.
 Hold up!
 You thinking what I'm thinking?
 I'm thinking I'm thinking too.
 Slow up!
 What time is it dawg?
 It's time for a switcharoo
 We both love our moms, women with grown-women needs
I say we break 'em off
Show 'em how much they really mean,
'Cause...
I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should fuck each other's mothers
 Fuck each other's moms
I'll push in that lady where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt this shit is crazy
 Fuckin' each other's moms
'Cause every Mother's Day needs a Mother's Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin' on you 'cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover
 I'm laying in the cut waitin' for your mom clutchin' on this lube and roses
 I got my digital camera, I'm gonna make your momma do a million poses
 They will be so surprised
 We are so cool and thoughtful
 Can't wait to pork your mom
 I'mma be the syrup, she can be my waffle
 Show love!
 My mama loves bubble bath with chamomile
 Straight up!
 Give it to my mom d-d-d-d-d-d-doggy-style
 This the perfect plan
 For a perfect Mother's Day
 They'll have to rename this one
 All up under the covers day
Cause I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should fuck each other's mothers
 Fuck each other's moms
I'll push in that lady
Where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt this shit is crazy
 Fuckin' each other's moms
 Break it down
 It would be my honor to be your new step-father
 It would be my honor to be your new step-father
 While you're in my mother make me another brother.
And while I'm in your mother I'll never use a rubber
 OH!
'Cause every Mother's Day needs a Mother's Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm calling on you cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover
They blessed us both with the gift of life
She brought you in this world so I'mma sex her right
This is the second best idea that we've ever had
The choice can be no other
Be my mother lover
 Happy Mother's Day.
Hi, I'm John Waters, and this is...
The Creep.
When you're out in the club and you see a fly girl
Do the Creep hah
Do the Creep hah
And if you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do the Creep hoo
Do the Creep hah
Well, we got a new dance so get up on your feet
It's real easy to do, and it's called 'The Creep'
Let your hands flap around like a Marionette
Pop your knees up and down, sh-sh-shaking your neck
Now pull your waistband up like you expectin' a flood
And slick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
Put this in your speakers; you a certified creeper.
When you see a country peach, laying out at the beach
Do the Creep hah
Do the Creep hah
And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree
Do the Creep hoo
Do the Creep hah
I was six years old when I started creepin'
My parents took it to their room and I started peepin'
You can't imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads
And saw my little ass creepin' at the foot of the bed
Yeah they knew I was a creep, since the day I was born
Poppin' out my momma like some kettle corn
Yeah the doctor caught my head and he started freakin'
'Cause I came out clean - and I came out creepin'!
Nicki,
Nicki,
Nicki, Nicki, Nicki
Nicki!
When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room
Hide deep inside - it was my little creep stalker room
As they disrobed, I was oogling and oggling
Little did they know, that for me, they were modeling
And I would laugh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha.
And they would dance, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la.
So pop-pop-pop your peepers,
and tweak out your sneakers
Don't sleep, come on get your Creep on with me!
Go on, get to sweatin' off a bride at her wedding
Do the Creep hah
And do the Creep hah
And when you sneak into a wake, and you see a beefcake
Do the Creep hoo
And do the Creep hah
And when the judge is a hottie and you can't control your body
Do the Creep hah
Do the Creep hah
So, get your knees flexin', and your arms T-rexin',
And Creep hoo
Do the Creep! hah
